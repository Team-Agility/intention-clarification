A: Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go
B: I think you can if you have a scale , so
C: No no , you don't have to y no
C: it's uh when you when you stop t uh
C: when you stop , the the turn ,
A: Mm-hmm .
C: then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you
D: Yeah .
D: How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?
-> C: It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the
--> D: So you you count one degree , two degrees , no .
-> C: Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it .
-> D: I don't think so .
int-tr,

B: Um , I
A: um , for the meeting ,
A: but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close .
A: Um , what was
A: I missed the last moment , reading that .
A: What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?
D: Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
-> D: Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .
--> A: Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed .
-> D: Yeah ,
B: Yeah .
D: and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow .
B: So , self-timed
D: So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it .
A: Yeah .
D: Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds .
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
-> A: Okay , so
not,

A: No .
C: Well , titanium s
A: Oh what did you
A: Oh sorry ,
A: go ahead .
C: I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then I would probably lean away from that .
D: Yeah ,
D: 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive .
A: Right .
-> B: However ,
--> A: What would you recommend ?
-> B: well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro
D: Yeah .
B: right ?
C: Yeah .
B: 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium ,
C: That'll
C: Yeah , exactly .
A: Mm .
B: make them a rarity so to speak .
C: The selling point , yeah .
not,

A: Yeah , I like that .
A: 'Kay .
D: But we definitely
D: If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled .
A: Mm .
D: Yeah ,
D: like on the side of it .
B: Well , if it's just up and down
D: Oh if it's just up and down .
-> C: But is that for
--> B: Volume or channel .
-> C: Which ?
-> B: I don't know .
int-rec,

A: 'Kay any other ideas ?
C: Um what colour ?
A: Oh , yeah . Latex covers . W
B: We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on ,
B: so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available .
C: Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that .
D: Yeah .
C: And that's at the bottom of it .
-> A: I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though ,
A: because if people are able to change the covers ,
--> C: Which button ?
-> A: I don't know ,
A: maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button ,
A: I don't know ,
A: but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get
A: another one .
A: Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ?
A: Every cover ?
B: Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky .
A: Yeah .
B: So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea .
low,

B: 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs ,
B: so please press something .
B: And as I said , it's perfect .
A: Okay .
B: Please press it .
C: Experience . Explanat
B: Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device .
D: Such a nice thing .
C: See this .
-> B: So you can touch it with your hands .
--> D: Can I ?
D: Ho-ho .
-> B: Sure . Yes .
C: You can
D: 
A: What do you say ?
B: N
-> D: It says
int-tr,

C: 
A: You want to go ?
D: I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff .
B: Hmm .
C: 
-> D: My favourite animal is
D: 
C: You wa
A: 
B: Wow .
--> A: A human
C: 
-> D: Guess .
-> A: ah .
int-rec,

C: Huh .
A: Oh that . It won't doesn't
A: Maybe we should start with the the technical functions .
C: Okay ,
C: how can I get this on the whiteboard ?
A: Yeah ?
A: Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder .
B: In project .
C: Okay ,
-> C: I've done that .
--> A: You've already done that ?
B: No can that open .
-> C: Yes .
-> A: Well let's close this one .
A: We'll just uh open a new one .
int-tr,

A: well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated .
B: Look at the market .
A: We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably .
A: Yeah . I don't know .
A: I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote .
B: Well
A: I don't know what you th guys think .
D: Might be . Might be .
B: Yeah , I uh , it's
-> B: Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh
--> A: Yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ?
A: Or do you think it uh
A: I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function .
B: Well , uh when you uh uh when you look uh
-> B: for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th
A: Yeah .
-> A: Okay , it goes
A: Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now .
A: That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements .
not,

A: English .
A: .
C: So annoying .
A: Break is over .
D: Ooh it works .
A: Whoo .
D: Spicy .
A: Spicy .
D: Where are are all the other presentations ?
-> C: I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be
--> D: The conceptual or
-> C: yeah I think so . Yeah , conceptual design .
-> D: Ah . Because I see only my own presentation
low,

A: Yeah .
B: So okay .
A: Just yeah .
A: I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present .
B: Yeah .
B: Okay .
A: So I don't think you have to design anything else for that .
D: Yeah with the programme .
B: But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ?
-> A: Both .
--> B: For for everything ,
B: also for the advanced options ? Okay .
-> A: Yeah .
-> B: Uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design .
B: Everybody says it so that's what's uh
B: yeah um
B: Yeah
B: in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated .
B: That's yeah obvious .
B: Um yeah .
B: Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control .
B: And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options .
low,

C: And
C: Exactly . Exactly .
A: Yeah . So it can bounce .
C: We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break .
D: Yeah , uh
D: It's very no it's very strong .
C: Th it's very solid yeah .
A: Yeah okay so that that may work .
D: Yeah .
-> C: That actually will offer some extra protection for the
--> A: Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape .
-> C: Yeah .
-> A: Yeah .
not,

B: Mm .
A: Ooh . .
D: Yeah .
D: Well it works pretty well .
B: Yeah .
A: 
D: And then time was up .
-> A: Uh not yet .
D: Uh
D: .
--> C: Do you get a pop-up if we
-> A: Yeah within five minutes yeah .
D: That you have five minutes left or
-> C: Alright .
not,

D: That should be pretty nice colour .
D: But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people .
A: Yeah yeah .
C: No
D: Because the of the green .
C: that's actu
B: But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ?
D: Yeah .
A: They have LEDs but they have a colour .
-> C: Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind .
--> D: Yeah ?
-> C: They will see one of each as grey .
-> D: Yeah .
int-tr,

D: Yeah .
A: Okay with
A: Uh
A: Don't mean to discourage you
A: but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard .
A: Next thirty minutes to design something so
C: Ah , right .
D: Alright .
A: And the
-> A: You will do the evaluation .
--> D: Of the product ?
-> A: Yeah .
-> D: Which we don't have yet .
int-rec,

B: But why why do we need uh the flipping uh
C: you can adjust the angle to which it flips .
C: So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there .
B: Okay . Yeah .
C: You can flip it up to there if you want .
D: Yeah .
D: So w yeah .
D: But we still keep the flipping mechanism .
-> C: Think so .
B: Yeah .
--> A: Yeah we keep the flip ?
A: Keep the flip live .
-> C: Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that
B: 
D: 
B: Yeah .
C: I dunno .
D: 
B: Uh the the shape is okay but
B: yeah ?
B: I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism .
C: I thought it would be cool .
ambig,

B: Wh what we could do is um
C: 
-> B: drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons .
C: Yeah .
A: Buttons .
A: That's
A: Oh yeah since we only have one button .
C: 
B: Yeah .
A: 
--> D: Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ?
A: I just m I don't I think
-> B: Just something else than than black or white I think .
A: Uh yeah it's I think it's grey , regular .
-> D: S yeah . Alright .
low,

D: Okay I will go go for two .
D: Uh the last one ?
D: The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics .
C: Oh .
C: No m
B: No we put the electronics into the fashion .
A: Yeah well yeah .
C: I would g
D: uh turn around . Yeah . But um
-> C: I would go for four .
--> D: Yeah ?
A: No
-> C: Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have .
D: It's not
-> D: Yeah , true .
int-tr,

D: Yeah .
D: Twenty eight
C: Yeah but
A: Divided by nine .
D: di divided by nine
A: So thr t two .
D: makes three point one one one one one one one .
-> A: So we're better than average .
C: But
D: Yeah .
--> C: I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ?
-> A: No .
D: 
-> C: I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative .
B: Some questions are Yeah .
C: So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better .
C: But if you give true to a negative question
ambig,

A: Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation .
A: Just uh do that quickly .
D: Yeah ?
A: Uh
D: How do you do it ?
A: Uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um
D: Alright .
A: So how were did the project process uh go ?
-> A: Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ?
A: Or are there uh
--> C: Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or
-> A: Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth .
-> C: Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast .
A: 
D: Yeah .
C: But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better .
D: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
C: And the third time yeah , I mean
low,

C: Yeah , it
A: But okay , we we'll impl
D: No , definitely not . Definitely not .
B: We'll discuss them in the usability lab .
A: No ,
D: 
A: we'll apply them then for now .
B: Uh eva evaluation .
B: I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary .
-> A: Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two .
--> B: Yeah ?
-> A: Yeah , I think so .
A: Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether
-> B: Okay .
int-tr,

A: Uh , I mean it's kind of , our design .
A: It's
D: Yes .
A: so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool .
C: Yeah .
D: Background colour .
A: I don't know or uh I don't know how you
D: How do you guys feel ?
-> C: I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own
A: Casting . Yeah .
--> D: The different designs .
-> C: yes , you can make it in your own uh
-> D: Yes .
low,

D: Go away .
C: You like the buttons .
D: I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten .
A: Remote control will be bought by
-> D: It will be bought by people under the age of forty .
C: Yes .
A: Yeah . Definitely .
B: Yes .
C: In in
A: Well
--> C: and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ?
-> D: No no no . No , just if they if they buy it .
A: Uh , just in general .
A: Yeah , a two .
-> C: We don't know .
not,

A: Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one
D: We can make a docking station for two thirty .
B: Wow , w why no li
A: we can still make
B: Look at now , we got two
D: Two thirty .
C: Fo for a docking station .
B: two thirty left .
-> D: We can make a docking station . Sure .
B: Ca can't we make a docking station of that ?
--> C: With a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it .
-> D: Sure .
B: I don't know .
D: The power device is is i i is very cheap .
D: That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever .
A: 
A: Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control .
-> C: Wi with a button to
ambig,

D: Okay .
B: but yeah you c ask away .
D: Can we uh power a light in this ?
D: Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ?
A: Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power ,
A: and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light
B: Mm .
D: Okay .
A: so that
-> D: So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery .
--> B: Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ?
D: Well
-> D: I mean I'm thinking it might be That for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it
B: Uh-huh .
-> B: Yeah .
int-tr,

B: or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere .
C: I think that might scare me .
B: I d I d any thoughts on that at all ?
C: I think that'd probably scare me .
C: You turn it on your control possessed s .
B: I know .
B: Um unless an a I mean if you
-> B: also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ?
B: Would we put that on the inside or
C: Um
--> A: Do we need an L_C_D_ display ?
A: What what's the functionality of that ?
-> B: It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought .
-> A: Yeah but the question is what are we using it
int-tr,

C: So
C: each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard ,
C: the pen's just underneath it there
C: and draw your favourite animal
C: and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are
C: and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project .
A: 
-> B: Why are you looking at me ?
D: 
B: 
--> C: Would you like to go first ?
-> B: Do I have a choice ?
A: 
B: Okay .
B: Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere .
C: Oh , yeah ,
B: Right , okay .
-> C: p put them in pockets .
not,

C: Right .
D: It's a it's great , it's a good idea ,
D: but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think .
D: Child-friendly , I thought this was good ,
D: as you pointed out the um
D: the bit , it often goes missing especially with children ,
D: but it's a good shape
D: and the organic is kind of
-> D: we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think .
C: Yeah .
--> A: So which vegetable ?
C: Well I mean we could make a
-> D: Yeah , I know , carrot .
C: Yeah .
C: Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s
A: Okay .
-> A: The the lemon .
not,

A: and a
D: Maybe , yeah .
A: maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric .
C: Huh .
D: Like what's what's that ,
D: I don't even know the name of it ,
D: some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing .
D: I don't know the name of that .
A: So it'd look like this kinda .
-> D: Yeah , that's what I was thinking .
--> A: Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?
C: Uh .
-> D: Yeah , maybe that's what they are .
C: 
D: 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit
D: and
-> A: Yeah ,
A: and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end .
low,

B: sorry ,
B: I put it in the shared documents .
C: Uh right ,
C: that's that's the that
B: Uh yeah .
C: it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents .
C: Project Documents is on the um desktop .
B: Right , that's great .
-> B: But I cou can't open that , because it w asks uh for some username or password .
A: Oh .
--> C: Really ?
-> B: I'll show you .
A: Uh these lapel mics are trouble .
B: Ts
-> C: Oh right ,
C: I think um
C: Hold on .
int-tr,

B: a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .
A: Okay .
B: Yeah ?
C: What do you mean by linear access then ?
B: Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .
C: Ah .
B: Um .
A: Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access
A: and there's a fourth one no ?
-> B: Mm ?
--> A: So the better now for special navigation ?
-> B: Yeah .
B: For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ?
-> A: Okay .
A: Then linear access
not,

C: Yeah .
A: Cos it would be costly
A: uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control .
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah yeah .
C: Yeah .
B: Mm
B: I it's not true I think .
-> B: The the second claim that you put .
C: No no .
--> A: That it would be too long to develop .
-> B: Yeah .
D: 
B: I think that should be the same .
-> A: Oh yeah .
A: Because I received that email from management board
A: and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important .
A: So maybe it's a good decision .
A: I dunno .
A: What's your opinion ?
low,

D: oh , okay , uh I have to expla explain something .
D: We have to uh be consensive about about things .
D: So , it has to be a group uh group decision .
D: Okay ?
A: Okay ,
A: so we gon we gonna evaluate the
D: Uh
D: We're going to vote .
D: We
-> D: yeah ? The prototype .
--> A: Yeah , the the thing we saw .
-> D: Yeah .
-> A: Okay , just saw .
ambig,

D: It's it's not
C: So , it's w yeah , it it it
D: yeah , it
C: it isn't entirely unclear ,
D: J
C: but
C: So , I wouldn't give it a seven .
-> C: I would give it a more a five or a six .
B: No .
B: Yeah .
--> D: Five ?
D: Okay .
-> C: Uh , I don I don't know .
C: What do you think , uh Mister Project Manager ?
-> D: Yeah ,
D: it's it's yeah .
ambig,

C: Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft .
B: kinda soft , but but not this .
A: Yeah , but not too soft we have decided .
D: Three ?
B: Yeah .
A: Three , yeah .
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah yeah , easy to use ,
-> A: Easy to use . One .
B: very afford .
--> D: Easy to use ?
-> A: Yeah , can it be zero ?
C: Well , I don yeah , it is kind of
-> D: Top easy to use ?
D: It's it's not the most easy to use
int-tr,

A: No ?
D: Advanced chip .
C: No .
A: No , advanced chip .
B: No .
C: Yes .
A: Sample sensor sample speaker ?
B: No , the advanced chip is uh
C: No .
-> D: Advanced chip is three .
--> A: Three ?
-> D: Three Euros , yep .
B: Yeah .
C: Uh , we have one . We have one
-> A: Yeah uh , but it it's one one thing , it's three Euro .
low,

D: Yeah .
B: 
D: You Yeah .
C: 
D: No , you have to put uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second
A: Oka okay , okay ,
A: I
A: I really didn't knew that .
D: Oh nay ,
-> D: a volume changing , second .
--> A: So , this one's first .
-> D: S switch , yes .
-> A: You go there and you go there .
ambig,

A: So what that means is that um
B: And so we've got point three to get rid of .
B: Um and we ha
B: where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ?
A: The twelve buttons that you see there .
B: Twelve buttons .
D: That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so
B: Yeah .
A: Functionally you're gonna have to intercept
-> A: So four is a good estimate for
--> B: Do you think ?
-> A: Yeah ,
A: so you can't actually cut
A: It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .
-> B: Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons ,
B: how can it be something in between ?
int-tr,

C: Mm-hmm .
B: Okay .
B: Very good .
B: Um what about leadership ?
A: 
B: I don't know if that means like , if I did a good job or something .
B: I don't really know .
A: 
C: Yeah , well well I mean
-> C: my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement
--> B: From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ?
C: Yeah from
-> C: and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader .
-> B: Okay .
int-rec,

A: Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
C: Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ?
A: Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .
C: Okay .
D: How many should we sell then ?
D: Um , a lot ,
A: Anyone a mathematician ?
D: two two two million ,
D: two mi no ,
-> D: more f four million .
--> B: Two million .
-> D: Four million .
D: And it
D: well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .
B: 
-> B: Oh , yeah .
low,

B: And thus gives on the signal .
B: Now this is the simple version .
B: Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time .
B: We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well .
B: And not only that .
B: Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell .
B: Um I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic ,
B: rubber , as well .
B: Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls .
-> B: So it's pretty squishy .
--> D: Spongy ?
-> B: That would that would serve that purpose .
B: Um we could also use wood , or titanium .
C: 
A: What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ?
D: 
C: 
B: Oh fya
D: 
B: I don't have an information on that .
B: However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it .
low,

C: They're they're expensive ,
B: What kind of price are we looking at for
C: they don't
B: I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
A: It's twelve point f
C: Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest
C: I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones ,
C: um but the
-> C: It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping ,
C: 'cause if you drop stuff
--> B: Solar .
-> C: yeah
C: if you if you have y
-> B: Well they're not designed
low,

A: and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have ,
A: like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh
C: Well , yeah we
A: I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here ,
C: Yeah .
A: so we we we would not change h that particular pattern
A: because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .
B: I can't see that ,
B: is that play and stop and things ?
-> A: This is central one , the one you
--> B: Or is that volume and channel ?
-> A: yeah volume and channel .
A: So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models ,
A: if you look at all the models , it's here .
A: This and voice recognition .
-> B: Okay .
B: Right . Okay . Um
B: I'm not sure how long we've got left ,
B: but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed .
B: So , we agree on
B: Do we agree on the battery ?
ambig,

B: it's it will be cheaper
B: and it is less technology than , you know
B: For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to
A: True .
C: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?
B: I think it's cheaper than laser , so .
C: Yeah .
A: Okay .
C: Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ?
-> C: Twelve , nearly thirteen ,
--> A: What the cost is ?
-> C: yeah . The cost
B: Yeah ,
B: I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh
-> A: Twelve , twelve a half .
low,

C: On your
C: No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also .
C: So why not on your remote ?
A: Yeah , but no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually .
D: Yeah , I don't know .
A: And it's also not I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something ,
B: Well well what would you display on it then ?
A: it's
-> C: Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide
D: Programme information .
--> B: But is it isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ?
D: But
-> C: on t on teletext , yes . Also on the internet .
D: Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a
C: But
A: But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control .
B: Yeah .
C: Yes , but you also want to know what's next .
D: But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s
D: which we were planning to ,
-> B: Yeah ,
B: and we also have to yeah .
int-tr,

A: No .
D: No , definitely not .
B: It's a g a little bit too flashy .
A: Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting .
D: Yes , definitely .
C: Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well uh
A: Okay .
A: But we have to uh think of some other uh important things .
C: 
-> A: Uh oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons .
--> B: The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea .
-> A: No .
D: No , I think that's too vulnerable .
A: 
-> B: Yeah .
not,

B: 'Kay .
-> A: You all saw the newsflash ?
C: It's
A: Or you got the same message ?
D: Yeah I I just saw it one minute ago .
A: Yeah sorry .
C: I don't know .
D: When I uh
C: I didn't see it yet I think .
D: Yeah .
--> B: Newsflash ? D did I miss something ?
A: Yeah .
-> A: Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but
D: Yeah pretty much .
C: Hey what's wrong with my computer ?
B: Okay .
A: Is it unlocked ?
D: Mm .
C: .
B: No .
D: Yeah that's my presentation .
A: Woah .
int-tr,

D: Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it .
B: Yeah .
A: 'Kay . Um
A: for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ .
A: Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty ,
A: but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well .
D: Mm .
A: And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control .
-> A: And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group .
A: We have to make be clear what that is .
--> D: group of users , or
-> A: Yeah users .
-> D: because it says below forty I mean .
low,

D: Okay for example if you put the screen here ,
D: it's more about the functions now than the than the layout .
A: Yeah okay that's true . Layout .
A: That's for the
D: Doesn't work too well .
D: It's uh it's bent .
A: 
B: 
-> A: I can't help it .
D: .
--> B: You broke it .
-> A: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
C: .
D: Right .
A: Man .
A: Yeah okay .
D: Okay you get it .
D: Uh for example if y if you put all the
A: 
D:
int-rec,

B: It wouldn't be very fancy .
D: 
B: You can have a kinetic provision of energy ,
B: which is used on some watches these days .
B: So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work .
D: Mm .
B: Or you can use solar cells ,
-> B: but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but
C: Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .
B: Yeah .
--> A: Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ?
D: Mm .
-> B: I dunno actually .
-> A: Does anybody know ?
not,

A: you know .
A: So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .
B: So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .
A: Yeah .
A: S yeah , push buttons .
D: What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?
C: I think push-buttons is
A: What about what ?
-> D: G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .
B: Well
--> A: Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?
-> D: Mm , I dunno .
D: Be cool .
B: It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it ,
D: Channel two .
C: Yeah .
B: I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and
A: S
C: Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh ,
-> A: Yeah .
C: 'cause uh
not,

A: so bef before you all disappear off just
C: Okay ,
C: I'll stay in here .
D: um .
C: 
A: hold hold fire . Um .
C: Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that
-> A: Um I think , it's uh , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product .
B: 
D: 
--> C: So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company .
-> A: Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment .
-> C: So we really have a incentive to make this remote work .
low,

A: That's one Euro .
C: One Euro discount .
C: 
A: So , I don't think that's good .
A: Mm
A: I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ .
A: If
C: If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .
A: Yes .
-> A: Then it's only thirteen Euros .
--> C: And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?
A: So uh yeah .
A: Yeah . Then you have
-> A: Or you have to cut this off .
C: Uh uh-uh .
A: Then it's not good anymore .
-> C: No .
not,

A: Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that
C: Just bad ones .
A: Yeah . That's true .
C: Um .
B: What kinda battery would we want to use ?
B: Because battery changing is usually
C: D
C: Double A_ .
-> D: Double A_ .
B: Okay .
--> A: Do some of them use triple A_s though ?
-> D: Yeah some use triple A_s .
C: Some but
D: So double or triple ?
A: Okay .
C: Yeah ,
C: I guess then it's
C: If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around .
-> A: Okay . Yeah .
A: But that has to do with the size of it too .
C: Right .
not,

A: I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .
C: Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So
B: 
D: Yeah
D: I use it like that .
-> B: W when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .
A: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
C: Yeah , so
--> A: But , were there buttons on there as well ?
-> B: Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do .
A: Mm .
A: Yeah .
C: Mm yeah .
B: So we just used the top part .
A: Yeah .
C: Yeah ,
D: Uh .
C: so
C: but I mean I think it could be pretty small .
not,

D: Hey , Project Manager .
A: 
B: Um , Project Manager , I have something to tell you .
A: Mm yeah .
B: I have a little problems with my laptop .
A: Okay .
B: And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete .
A: Okay .
-> B: No , a little problem , uh big problem .
B: I just thought
--> D: What was it , problem ?
-> B: Um , it didn't work anymore .
-> D: The laptop ?
not,

C: Uh , well f first off , let's start start with the energy .
C: W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources .
A: Mm-hmm .
C: But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic .
C: Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy .
C: I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power .
-> C: That would be actually very nice , uh I figured .
A: Oh .
C: Well , we could also use a battery ,
C: that's a bit
--> D: Yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ?
A: 
-> C: Yeah . Yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit .
B: 
D: Uh , and uh uh
C: And then then it d then it has some more uh energy .
A: 
C: Well , y you could just go for a battery .
D: Hmm .
C: Or you can go for both ?
B: Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?
C: Yeah , I actually did .
not,

B: Oh , yeah . Okay , I I get it .
A: Mm yeah .
C: So mm Uh uh so
C: uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ?
C: I I I prefer rubber .
D: Yeah , me too .
A: Me too .
-> B: Okay .
C: Yeah , you too ?
A: Yeah ?
--> C: You sure ?
C: You you you seemed to hesitate a bit .
-> B: That's good .
B: Well , as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm , and you don't uh it's not bendable or something ,
A: 
D: Mm yeah .
B: I th I think that goes too far .
-> C: Yeah , it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh
int-tr,

A: Mm yeah .
C: Well , I don't know .
C: I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it .
C: So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control .
C: But it would would be uh more expensive .
C: So , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model .
C: Could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance .
B: Oh , it's a p Yeah .
D: Yeah , but T_V_s aren't capable of sending .
-> C: Yes they are .
--> D: Yeah ?
-> C: Yeah .
-> D: I thought they were just
int-tr,

A: Uh idea that you uh
-> A: the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype .
D: 
B: 
A: And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard .
A: So that's a kinda new uh thing .
D: Ah .
A: And um , the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation .
A: But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
B: Um
--> C: So we're going to work together right now ?
B: Stay here and
-> A: Yeah , the well , uh dids this what I uh what I heard .
A: I
D: In the master class .
A: Not in the master class .
B: 
C: 
D: Yeah .
A: So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh
B: P_ .
A: But I think it was a very uh very good uh session , uh gentlemen .
not,

D: Okay .
D: I have a question .
C: Uh-huh .
D: Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?
C: Uh , I don't think so ,
C: because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency .
-> C: So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home .
D: Okay .
A: So can we use any any frequency ?
B: Yeah , it should be okay .
--> A: We have the right to use any frequency ?
-> C: Uh no
C: but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit .
C: We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range ,
C: and for this range we don't need to ask any permission .
-> A: Okay .
A: And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ?
A: And so do they have the same frequency , or ?
int-tr,

A: I'm Fabien Cardinaux
A: and uh I I guess you can present yourself .
A: So I dunno , you can starts .
C: 
B: Okay ,
B: so my name is Petre .
-> B: You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like .
B: I don't care .
A: Okay .
D: Uh my name's Bob Mor .
--> A: And you are ? In the project ?
-> B: Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic .
D: Oh , sorry .
A: 
D: 'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris .
D: I'm the Marketing Expert for this project .
B: Bob ,
D: Bob yeah .
B: okay .
C: My name is Hamed Getabdar ,
C: and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project .
not,

B: Okay .
A: Okay .
B: Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like
B: so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers .
B: Next , please .
B: Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television .
B: This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel ,
B: like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .
A: Nine what ? Nine channel uh switches ?
-> B: Pardon me ?
--> A: Nine channel switches ?
A: Is
-> B: Yes , nine numbers .
-> A: Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
not,

C: Yeah but uh
A: I can't say I found everything particularly helpful .
C: Yeah .
A: Like I
C: It didn't really
B: Yeah .
C: yeah .
A: It
-> D: I though it was brilliant no ?
B: My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .
--> A: Really ?
C: 
-> D: No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think .
B: Yeah it probably does .
C: So like a f
A: I mean m my problem
D: I think it depends on the role
D: no ?
C: Yeah I think so .
-> A: yeah , yeah .
A: 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff
A: right ?
int-tr,

D: Okay ?
D: Mm-hmm .
A: and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?
A: Um , or if
C: 
D: 
A: is that a function we want in the remote ?
D: Um , I haven't been able to
C: Um , do you have trouble whistling ?
-> A: I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right .
--> C: Really ?
C: Ooh .
-> A: Yeah
A: it just
A: I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ?
D: Mm-hmm , yeah
-> C: Yeah , I suppose that's true .
int-tr,

C: Um
A: Well hmm .
C: speech recognition I take it
D: 
A: Oh it's
C: I don't , I've
C: I know of no products um that use speech recognition well .
A: They're act there
A: there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it .
-> A: You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel .
--> C: Really ?
-> A: Yeah ,
A: it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem .
D: Mm .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one .
-> C: Yeah ,
C: or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing .
int-tr,

A: Well
D: Mm .
A: Something like this ? Or
B: Mm , yes .
A: Shapes or What do we need ?
D: Can make several uh concepts .
B: What ?
A: Yes , okay .
-> D: We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .
A: Okay .
--> C: More like something
-> D: Yeah I I I uh yes .
B: 
-> C: M like
C: Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it .
D: 
C: Uh
ambig,

D: We have two buttons missing .
D: The mute button .
D: And um , the to to uh have to uh numbers
A: Mute . And the other .
C: 
B: 
D: Okay .
A: Yeah . Not so difficult .
D: But , uh
-> C: Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle .
--> A: But how do you wanna solve it ?
-> C: With the switch button .
-> A: Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .
A: Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down .
ambig,

D: How minutes ?
A: 
A: Failure .
A: Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email .
A: I don't think I can uh say much about it ,
A: so uh uh wait for your email
A: and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes ,
A: and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes .
D: One question ,
-> A: Yeah ?
--> D: uh how late do we have to get back be back here ?
A: Uh well uh
-> A: thirty minutes .
B: A quarter to one maybe ?
A: Uh , yeah .
-> D: Thirty minutes lunch break ?
not,

A: Okay .
D: 
D: Mm .
A: Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal ,
A: but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little
D: 
D: Mm-hmm .
A: Uh .
-> A: I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh .
C: 
--> B: Really ?
D: 
B: Oh that's a
-> A: Yeah .
A: no
C: 
B: 
C: A prairie dog ?
A: no
A: uh
C: Oh a squirrel ?
A: That's exactly what it is .
C:
int-tr,

A: Mm-hmm .
B: So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance .
D: 
B: Now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_ .
A: Mm-hmm .
B: There should be a signal
B: uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television
B: if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it .
D: Mm-hmm .
-> B: Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice .
--> A: On the on on the remote .
-> B: Yes . Yes .
-> A: Yeah , mm-hmm .
int-rec,

C: The turbo button .
B: So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button .
A: Okay .
C: Additional button .
D: What this button for ?
B: This is a teletext button .
D: Okay .
B: So once you press that then you get teletext
B: and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh
-> A: To navigate it through th through teletext .
--> D: But if you want to go to page seven hundred ?
B: To navigate yeah .
C: That's right , that's right .
B: Yeah .
-> A: with the wheel it's easy .
D: How man
B: Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing ,
B: you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields
B: and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh
-> D: I don't understand it .
D: Can you repeat it ?
ambig,

D: Yeah .
A: So this is one , which one is this one ?
D: Yeah .
A: 
A: 
D: Okay .
D: I I const
D: I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements .
D: And each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria
-> D: so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .
--> C: Why this strange factor of seven ?
D: Because i
D: I'm sorry . Sorry .
C: Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten .
D: Ah yeah .
D: It's from
D: sorry ,
D: it's from one to seven . It's from from one to seven
D: sorry .
-> D: Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale ,
C: Okay .
A: Num number
C: Okay . Mm-hmm .
D: and five
D: is too short and nine is too long .
C: Okay .
D: I'm a I I'm
-> C: Okay fine , got the idea .
int-tr,

A: So this is selling costs , not production costs .
D: Yeah this is the the initial specifications .
B: Yeah . Yeah .
A: Yeah yeah sure .
A: Um
A: Five .
D: I would say six .
D: It's quite cheap actually .
-> B: I'd say two .
A: Aw , should be nice in your
--> C: Why ?
D: 
-> B: I don't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote .
-> C: No but it's really handy actually if you see .
int-tr,

A: because it cost nothing .
D: 
B: Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic .
C: Yeah .
C: That's right .
A: 
C: So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go
A: Exactly exactly
-> A: so we have margin for that stuff .
C: That's right .
--> B: Does that include charging circuitry and everything ?
-> A: Yeah maybe .
A: Okay good .
C: Yeah .
A: Wha
A: Excellent .
-> B: So what do we do with the extra profits ?
not,

B: give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective .
D: 
C: 
D: Okay , well um
D: what
D: what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb ,
B: Yes , yes .
D: that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands
C: Mm-hmm .
-> D: and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ?
--> A: Yes the buttons are all raised , right ?
-> D: The buttons are all raised
B: Yes .
-> A: Are raised , mm-hmm .
not,

B: Okay .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Yeah .
A: Um I just realised one thing .
D: Yes .
A: In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .
B: Yes .
D: Ah .
C: Yeah .
-> A: And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .
--> D: Well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ?
-> A: Eight , eight twenty , yes .
C: Eight twenty so
-> D: And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend .
not,

B: perhaps we should have a backup plan
B: that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive .
C: Yeah sure , sure .
D: Yeah .
A: Yeah , okay .
A: But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay .
D: Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah .
B: Yeah .
-> D: Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly .
C: 
--> B: The L_C_D_ ?
-> D: Yeah ,
-> B: Oh that's a bit of a problem .
low,

C: I know .
D: What is it ?
C: 
A: it's very um bland looking ,
A: it's just text on the screen ,
C: Yeah ,
C: it's like black , black and white kind of
A: not even
A: Yeah ,
-> A: just black with just text .
--> D: Like running along the bottom ?
-> A: Yeah .
B: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so
C: It'll give you the sports .
-> D: Wait ,
D: is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ?
int-rec,

C: yeah okay .
A: Mm 'kay .
C: Tracking .
D: Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech .
A: Okay .
A: Right .
B: What if we gave it a charger ?
B: And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger ,
C: But you got a base .
-> B: and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .
--> D: Do you think people'll really go for that though ?
D: Because
-> B: It's useful for the remote phone .
A: Hmm .
D: Yeah .
A: Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ?
-> D: I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base .
ambig,

D: Dang it .
A: 
A: And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot .
D: Alright .
B: 
A: It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here .
B: Okay .
B: No , that's okay .
B: Joost , your mouse .
-> D: What ?
--> B: No mouse needed ?
-> D: I've got a touch-pad .
D: Do you know how how I can wake it up ?
B: Mm .
-> B: A touch-pad ?
not,

D: Yeah .
A: the technical functions design .
A: And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi
A: Well , this one was already clear to us .
A: Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
D: 
A: I don't know how much time we have left .
A: Oh , not many I guess .
A: We started at twelve .
-> D: You just got a message .
--> A: Oh , and what does it said ?
-> D: And it said uh five minutes , so we got four and a half .
B: Oh , I don't
A: W
-> A: Okay , well um
not,

D: Yeah .
A: It does make sense from maybe the design point of view
A: 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .
B: Yeah , yeah .
D: Yeah .
A: So , possibly .
D: Yeah .
B: Okay .
D: And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price .
-> D: I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so
--> B: What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?
D: Just a chara just a characteristic of the
B: Like how much money people have to spend on things like ?
D: Just
-> D: Or just like , basic product podi positioning ,
D: the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London ,
D: might not be such a big hit in Greece ,
D: who knows ,
-> B: Aye , I see what you mean , yeah .
ambig,

B: Uh
A: Doesn't really matter .
C: I don't know the functions .
A: Just just uh
B: It doesn't really matter .
B: That's
C: Okay .
B: Yeah well we don't have any uh
C: What else ?
-> B: Hmm ?
--> C: What else ?
-> B: What else ?
B: Uh menu buttons with arrows .
-> C: Uh menu .
not,

D: The speech function is new .
B: And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .
D: The scrollwheel
D: and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new .
A: Slide is not n is is not new . No .
A: I already have a
D: Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .
-> A: Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it .
D: Okay .
A: So that's not new .
--> B: But also slide that buttons come out , as well ?
C: 
-> A: Yeah .
-> B: Okay .
not,

C: Hmm .
B: I do agree with that .
B: Yeah , tu-dum .
B: English is not so hard by the way .
C: No .
D: I'm breaking a world record here .
B: Well , leader ?
D: Oh shit .
B: Project Manager ?
-> D: We've got a problem , Paul .
--> B: You do ?
B: Yeah , you have to make a choice .
-> D: Yes .
D: No it's your choice .
-> B: Wow , that's pretty quick .
int-tr,

C: 'Kay .
D: Uh-huh .
B: No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only .
D: Okay .
-> B: So we are showing our preference for particular fruits ,
C: Being fruitist .
A: 
B: two or three kinds rather ,
B: and
B: Yeah .
--> D: Is that no is that not trends ?
B: So .
-> B: Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that ,
C: 
C: 
B: because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes ,
B: like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things .
D: Mm-hmm .
B: Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape .
A: 
D: Mm-hmm .
B: So you can what shape a person will like .
ambig,

A: it isn't ,
B: it doesn't .
A: well okay .
C: put the cor cursor on the .
A: Remember .
D: Okay okay okay .
D: Remote control mainly be sold to younger people .
C: Click .
C: True .
-> B: I think it will ,
--> D: Yeah ?
C: True .
-> B: yeah .
-> D: True ?
D: Very true ?
int-tr,

C: No , no ,
C: you you can start .
D: Okay , I'll start .
A: So start , uh
D: Can you open my presentation ,
D: please .
A: 
A: Uh .
D: I'm number four .
-> D: Trend .
--> A: This one ?
-> D: Yep .
D: Can you pass the mouse ,
D: please .
D: Oh okay , that's fine .
-> A: Turn .
low,

A: He wants a small remote control ,
C: Uh .
D: Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand .
A: or ?
A: Uh uh with big buttons .
-> B: I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .
C: Yes .
A: It's difficult .
B: 
A: A sm
--> D: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ?
C: 
-> B: W I I think so .
B: I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow
B: Well , that's that's no task for me ,
B: but well seven to seven at least yeah ,
C: 
A: So maybe you can finish your presentation ,
B: but
A: and afterwards we will discuss about all this .
C: Maybe this .
B: Oh , okay .
ambig,

B: And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally .
B: There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago .
B: A bit out of date .
B: Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .
A: Um
A: What is a hand-powered dynamo ?
B: Um , where you manually charge up the power .
B: Like you wind up something .
A: Just every , every once in a while ?
-> B: Sorry ?
--> A: Just every once in a while or constantly ?
-> B: Yeah . Every once in a while I think
B: . But it's
-> A: Alright .
A: It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think .
not,

C: Yeah .
B: It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming .
C: And that all interfaces are different .
C: So , um ,
C: that doesn't improve the use of the produ product ,
C: so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand .
C: And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .
A: Mm-hmm .
B: Yep .
-> C: Does anyone have any questions ?
--> A: Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .
-> C: Mm .
D: I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to .
D: Just because of colour clashing ,
D: and if we wanted to ,
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
D: so and ,
D: and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .
C: But um
-> A: But what about the lighting up effect ?
not,

B: I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy ,
A: if there is backup .
B: and
B: be bold and innovative ,
C: 
-> B: and hope this works , and well hope that it works .
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
B: I think
B: yeah .
--> A: There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ?
B: I think
-> B: no .
D: So
B: I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential .
-> A: Yeah .
A: It could even be one of our selling points .
ambig,

B: Yeah .
B: I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult
B: because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the
A: 
A: Sorry ,
A: what is your ?
B: Uh participant three .
B: You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so .
-> D: Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate ,
D: so yeah yeah .
--> B: Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_ sound turns off .
-> D: Yeah
D: uh channel fifty .
D: Yeah .
C: No
C: it could be command control kind of thing .
C: It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .
C: Means you say
C: you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition .
B: Yeah .
C: Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also .
int-rec,

C: Means th yeah twenty five Euros is yeah , that's right .
B: Well this is what we need to find out .
D: it's
B: Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ?
B: 'Cause otherwise we need
A: Okay this is
A: this is an open question for you .
A: Yeah .
A: This is uh up to you to tell us .
-> A: But I'm definitely not keen on to to
--> D: To move to another target ?
-> A: no no no ,
A: I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies .
A: I'm not confident enough .
A: I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work .
A: I uh that work
B: It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna
A: It's real
A: yeah .
A: How to guarantee such performances is really hard .
B:
int-rec,

C: Sorry about that .
C: Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available
C: and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
B: Okay .
C: I have some uh initial ideas about some things
C: um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion .
C: One thing about uh interopera operability .
C: Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment .
-> C: Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment .
C: So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .
--> B: And for a cell phone ?
-> C: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
-> B: Yeah , okay .
B: Yeah .
int-tr,

C: Okay .
A: Okay .
A: Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting .
C: Do do you
A: Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product ?
A: Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?
D: Uh I think most most things have already been said ,
D: like uh control multiple devices .
A: Mm-hmm .
-> D: And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .
--> A: Because ?
D: Uh well , he said about n abo
-> D: what he said about pointing .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: But uh lots of devices already use infrared .
D: So
D: we'll probably have to implement that .
-> A: Okay .
A: Okay .
A: Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?
int-tr,

A: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .
C: Yeah . Okay .
C: So
C: Is our target group then people
-> C: so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?
C: So
A: I think that seems to yeah . Mm .
B: It's easy to implement .
C: Okay .
C: So the
--> D: the the buzzer you mean ,
-> C: yeah , yeah , yeah .
-> D: yeah , for sure , yeah .
low,

A: We could we could even have four buttons ,
A: like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .
D: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
C: So volume could be like the top it and the bottom
C: So do you need to
B: Doesn't it rotate though ,
C: okay .
B: so it'll be moving around .
-> C: Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like
--> D: What do you mean the function ?
C: I mean like okay , 'cause so
C: I dunno , I guess Okay
-> C: so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise .
C: That that means you're gonna go up the channels ,
C: and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
B: Mm-hmm .
C: But then
C: so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where
C: like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .
-> D: Yeah but it knows for some reason .
low,

D: the current
D: the n
D: current trends ?
B: Yeah .
D: Yeah ?
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Okay .
D: Okay .
D: Well wha what I found
-> D: um can you
--> A: Next slide ?
-> D: Yeah .
-> A: Yeah .
int-rec,

D: I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people
D: because they are more open to new devi new devices
B: To fruit ?
D: and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was
D: was was able to
D: to buy a a n a cooler remote control .
B: But is it uh is fruit cool ?
D: What ?
A: That's a question .
-> D: What ?
--> B: Is fruit cool ?
-> D: Yeah ?
D: Uh
D: Is the new trend
D: of the
-> B: Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so ,
B: imagi
D: 
B: just 'cause they have an apple on their
B: on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool .
not,

C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B: But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase .
C: Okay .
B: So , I mean , you know ,
B: I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control .
C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
-> B: But basically the thing is , we have this technology available
--> C: In-house .
-> B: in-house .
B: So , um
C: Mm-hmm .
B: but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components ,
C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B: so um it it
B: but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done .
C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B: Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it ,
A: I
int-rec,

C: Stable thing , that's right . To have ,
B: I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing , so .
C: mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B: But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume ,
A: Mm .
B: because it's it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so .
C: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B: But um ,
B: I've also included this turbo button
-> B: because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button ,
--> D: What's a turbo button ?
B: and well
-> B: so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll ,
B: so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh
B: Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them ,
B: in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station .
B: Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing .
-> D: It con it controls the speed ?
low,

C: These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company
C: and we we can go ahead with that .
A: Okay .
C: Yeah , we can go to the next slide .
C: Then uh there are different kind of chips ,
C: one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip .
C: So we can have regular chip for control .
C: Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip .
-> C: And uh regular chip supports speaker support ,
C: so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced .
--> B: So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of
-> C: It could be a beep kind of thing .
-> B: Okay ,
B: but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ?
low,

C: They are not going to cost you much ,
C: everything is in-house
C: and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this .
B: Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote
C: Oh , yeah .
B: in the first place , you know .
C: That's that's another issue which I didn't think of .
B: Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um
-> C: But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make .
D: What about
--> B: Yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ?
B: I can't remember ,
-> C: Twenty five .
D: 
C: Twelve point five is the profit on one .
A: Twenty five .
-> B: Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ?
not,

C: Yeah .
C: You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .
A: Hmm .
C: Says
C: Yeah .
C: It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions .
C: But I guess it could be
A: And could it be adapted ?
C: I guess it's possible .
-> C: I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command .
--> A: Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?
-> C: Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff ,
C: so if they already have it as uh as a chip
A: Okay .
A: Yeah .
C: then we we could use it .
-> A: Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news .
ambig,

C: but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .
A: Yeah .
A: No
A: you you
A: I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty .
A: I think for lefty it's okay .
A: I can do this movement ,
A: and for righty as well .
A: I think this doesn't change that much .
-> C: Okay .
--> A: Yeah ?
-> C: Okay .
C: Maybe .
C: Yeah .
-> A: So ,
A: for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side .
A: And
A: and uh a wheel on the top .
B: Mm-hmm .
C: Yeah .
A: So the colour is yellow .
ambig,

B: Okay .
A: because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple .
B: Why is that ?
A: You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use .
A: Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .
D: Right .
B: Okay .
-> D: Could it be an on off thing ?
A: Um ,
D: Like if you want it on
--> B: Where you can activate it and deactivate it ?
A: but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology ,
-> D: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
A: rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this .
D: Yeah .
B: Okay .
D: Sure .
D: Sure .
A: So maybe we should
B: Okay .
low,

B: Paul Wiezer . Paul Wiezer .
A: W_I_E_S_ z Z_ or S_ ?
B: A_ E_ Z_ zee zee
A: Uh uh zee . Okay .
B: E_ R_ .
A: What's your name ?
C: Uh Martijn .
A: Yeah ,
A: but your surname .
-> C: What ?
--> A: Your surname .
-> C: Uh Abbing . A_ B_ B_ I_ N_ G_ .
-> A: Okay ,
A: thanks .
not,

B: Yeah .
C: We're wicked . Awesome .
A: Okay so
A: we're on to the
B: S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate .
C: Yeah .
A: We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation ,
A: where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell How's it going ?
A: Anyone got any thoughts ?
-> B: What ?
--> A: How how have we done today ?
-> B: I think we did pretty well .
C: Yeah .
-> A: I think we did pretty well too .
A: That looks pretty spectacular .
not,

D: Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy ,
D: but it's definitely different .
D: It's not your traditional
A: Oh definitely different yeah .
D: yeah .
B: I think the colour has a lot to do with it .
-> B: I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen .
D: Mm-hmm .
C: Yeah .
B: It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek
--> A: Oh you were only given red and black ?
-> B: red , black and yellow , and orange .
-> A: Oh okay .
int-rec,

D: Right . So , from one to seven ?
B: I will give I will
A: Mm uh
A: Seven is the ma the maximum ?
D: No , seven is false and one is true .
B: I'll gi
B: I'll give two or three .
B: Three , it's okay .
A: Three , I will say three .
-> B: Three , three .
--> D: Three ?
-> B: Three is fine for me .
-> D: Okay .
int-tr,

D: 'Kay .
C: Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable ,
C: because it's easier to use .
C: It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable .
C: Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design .
C: And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic .
C: And less functions would have to be included .
C: So it would be cheaper to make .
C: And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices .
-> C: Does anyone have any questions ?
--> D: So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?
-> C: Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices .
D: 
D: Right .
C: And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent ,
-> D: D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ?
not,

A: We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel .
C: No , we don't have the scroll .
B: 
A: Isn't
A: oh those are just regular buttons .
D: But it's
-> B: Well , that's the push-button too , right there .
C: Buttons .
D: Yeah ,
D: but i so i
--> A: This ?
-> B: Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button .
C: 
B: We're really having just push-button interface .
-> A: Okay ,
A: so we can just go um .
low,

A: 
D: That would be amazing , though , yeah .
A: 
C: 
D: No , splinters would
B: Yeah .
B: Um certain restrictions do apply here though .
B: Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one .
B: So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option .
-> B: Double-curved , you can't do titanium .
--> D: What is that ?
-> B: Um that would be two curvatures ,
B: so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold .
A: Mm .
D: Mm .
B: Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium .
B: And uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves .
C: Right .
B: I think I have one more slide .
A: 'Kay .
B: No , I didn't .
low,

D: So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ?
A: Yeah , I like that .
A: 'Kay .
D: But we definitely
D: If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled .
A: Mm .
D: Yeah ,
D: like on the side of it .
-> B: Well , if it's just up and down
D: Oh if it's just up and down .
--> C: But is that for
-> B: Volume or channel .
-> C: Which ?
ambig,

B: 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know .
D: That's squishy . That's squishy .
C: Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .
D: have buttons .
A: Mm .
B: Okay .
A: Yeah .
D: Yeah , that .
A: Hmm .
-> A: 'Kay any other ideas ?
--> C: Um what colour ?
-> A: Oh , yeah . Latex covers . W
B: We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on ,
B: so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available .
-> C: Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that .
D: Yeah .
C: And that's at the bottom of it .
not,

A: Think we can first
C: Right it was function F_ eight or something .
B: Mm .
C: This one right there .
B: Tha
B: Okay .
C: Okay .
B: Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ?
-> C: Think we all
C: Huh .
--> B: You will as well ?
-> C: Oh I thought we all were .
C: Yeah , I have one too , okay .
-> B: Okay .
A: .
C: S
B: Yep .
int-rec,

C: Then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate
D: Yeah .
A: Stay longer . Okay .
D: It should stay . Yeah .
C: Um , plus , yeah , it's price is really
A: Oops .
A: Okay , okay .
A: Um
-> C: Special colours , yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
--> B: For buttons .
C: Okay .
-> C: Yeah , buttons and strawberries .
-> B: No ,
B: buttons just normal .
int-rec,

D: Oh , of course yeah ,
B: 
D: the user requirement specifications ,
D: uh-huh , yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Okay . I'll think of that .
A: Mm okay .
A: So .
D: So ?
-> A: I think that's all .
--> D: Meeting's over ?
D: Great .
-> A: Yeah .
B: Okay .
C: Thank you .
-> D: Thank you .
int-rec,

C: But you can put them under the same button .
D: Not much more than that .
D: Yep .
A: Yeah , if as far as possible .
D: Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .
D: So t
A: But what do you think ?
A: Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ?
-> B: No .
D: 
--> A: No , you don't think so ?
-> B: No , new requirements say no .
-> A: Yeah , the new requirements say so .
int-tr,

A: and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something .
B: Yeah .
B: Maybe .
D: No , that's true uh , yeah .
A: And then you
A: you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know .
A: Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen .
D: Should we by the way draw um
A: this kind of looks you like .
-> D: on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of
--> A: Of the shape .
-> D: yeah .
B: Or the sh
-> A: Yeah , probably , it would be nice .
int-rec,

B: No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and
A: but you can
A: Yeah .
B: So okay .
A: Just yeah .
A: I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present .
B: Yeah .
B: Okay .
-> A: So I don't think you have to design anything else for that .
D: Yeah with the programme .
--> B: But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ?
-> A: Both .
-> B: For for everything ,
B: also for the advanced options ? Okay .
ambig,

D: 
B: But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons .
B: Um
B: I wanted to to categorise everything .
B: Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes .
B: Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light .
B: So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people .
A: Mm-hmm .
B: And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option .
-> B: Um that was it .
--> A: That was it ?
-> B: Yeah .
-> A: Okay . Uh
A: again . Ugh .
A: 
A: Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ?
A: Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface .
A: But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay .
A: So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy .
D: No .
A: Uh the case would be doubly curved . So
int-tr,

C: Mm-hmm .
D: Oh .
D: Something like that .
D: And the buttons are more ,
D: well it's very thick now but
C: Yeah I understand what you mean .
D: That's uh that's
C: How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop .
A: If you can uh flip .
-> C: So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first .
--> D: Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or
C: And then if you want
A: Uh so you have a the the side view .
-> C: Yeah . Something like that .
-> D: But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen .
D: But I dunno if that's too expensive .
int-rec,

D: I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno .
B: Yeah .
C: And also for people who are a bit colourblind .
A: Colourblind yeah .
D: Yeah . True .
A: No so that's mostly red and green I believe .
D: Which which uh colour should the buttons be ?
-> B: That's adjustable .
A: Woah .
D: Why adjustable ?
--> A: All all buttons ?
-> B: Yeah ? Or not .
-> A: Okay .
int-rec,

C: Alright .
A: Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out .
D: So something like this .
B: Yeah .
-> D: That should be pretty nice colour .
D: But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people .
A: Yeah yeah .
C: No
D: Because the of the green .
C: that's actu
--> B: But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ?
-> D: Yeah .
A: They have LEDs but they have a colour .
C: Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind .
D: Yeah ?
C: They will see one of each as grey .
D: Yeah .
C: But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same .
A: 
-> B: Okay .
int-tr,

A: 
B: Okay .
D: Okay .
C: I think .
D: So red buttons are okay ?
C: I think so .
B: Okay .
B: That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons .
A: You can make them red .
-> A: Yeah . But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light .
--> D: How do you mean ?
D: Yeah .
-> A: Uh they they don't determine the colour that much , I think .
B: Okay . Yeah
B: I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and
A: 'Cause you have to print on them you have a background
-> D: No that's that's too busy I guess .
int-rec,

C: Excuse me ?
D: Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable .
B: Yeah . Yeah .
C: No uh uh .
D: Maybe you should draw it very large like this .
B: Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly .
A: Yeah .
A: Sensitive .
D: Oh right .
-> C: How do we uh uh
--> D: Erase ?
-> C: or insert text ?
A: I dunno .
A: Maybe just start typing .
C: 
B: It's a bit uh large .
C: 
C: Oh that's a bit big . Yeah .
C: 
A: You also do the other sides .
A: Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view .
int-rec,

B: Yeah .
D: Mm .
B: So we have to to make it s uh more uh It has to be
A: So
A: You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality .
D: Yeah .
A: You just drop the Okay and the Back .
D: Wh wh what what what is the
D: what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ?
-> A: Oh , that's for the speech .
--> D: Speech recognition .
-> A: Yeah .
B: Could drop the speech recognition .
D: Right .
A: S s Drop speech recognition ?
C: 
C: No but
A: Yeah that's possible .
B: We we d
C: Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition .
C: 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons .
int-rec,

D: Um well , another question ,
B: Yeah that looks uh great .
D: uh the remote control is durable .
B: 
D: I don't know if that's the correct word .
B: Yeah . Nah
C: Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic
D: But uh
D: In use , both battery as casing ?
-> C: Yeah .
--> D: Yeah ?
-> C: Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever .
-> D: True , true .
int-tr,

D: yeah ?
C: Never mind .
B: Twenty four . Twenty six .
D: Tw
C: Twenty four . Twenty eight .
B: Oh , sorry . .
D: Twenty
D: Twenty eight .
B: Oh my .
-> A: That was the last one . That was that .
--> C: Twenty eight .
-> A: Yeah .
B: Okay . Twenty eight .
A: So divided by nine .
D: Twen Uh okay .
D: By nine .
B: Hmm .
D: That's uh three uh Or le less than a three .
A: So
-> C: Yeah the lower the
C: The lower the score the better , right ?
ambig,

A: Uh over there .
D: Uh Yeah ?
A: The presentation is still open .
A: So if you finish that then you'll see uh
A: Yeah next .
D: Next slide .
A: Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation .
-> A: Just uh do that quickly .
D: Yeah ?
A: Uh
--> D: How do you do it ?
-> A: Uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um
-> D: Alright .
int-tr,

B: Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: Yes , the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay .
B: That's great .
C: It's just something to to keep in mind ,
C: 'cause it's really really important .
A: Sure , sure , yes .
C: A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped ,
C: when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy .
-> B: Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact .
--> C: Really ?
-> B: Yes ,
-> C: That I didn't know .
int-tr,

C: but we can make
D: The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true .
D: But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit .
C: No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same .
D: Yeah , that's true ,
D: but uh
C: When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it .
D: Yes ,
D: but uh I I g
-> C: Just have to be big enough for the biggest
--> D: Shouldn't it fall then ? It isn't going to fall down ?
D: That's a bit uh
D: yeah , I think
-> C: No , when you make it large enough no it it will not .
C: But then it's a little bit
-> D: No , but if if
D: like this , I'll I'll point it out ,
D: if you got uh a a a base a base like this ,
not,

A: Or seven maybe , yeah .
B: No , six .
C: Six .
A: Or six .
D: Why uh why not a seven ?
B: Six .
A: Yeah , mine is seven .
-> C: Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative ,
B: Yeah .
C: but it but it
--> D: How ?
A: Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe
-> C: With the lights it it's it's kind of future
B: 
A: No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it .
-> D: Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ?
D: Well , it's n true . Uh , I agree ,
D: m but
int-tr,

A: Yeah , okay , you can also do that ,
A: but maybe
D: Wi wi without recharge
A: It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material .
D: Yeah ,
D: but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it .
D: I mean , it has a shape .
A: Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip ,
D: Of course it has a shape , but i i
-> A: then two Euros isn't even possible .
--> D: Why should that not be possible ?
A: Yeah , then
-> A: because then we'd thirty cents left .
-> D: No ,
D: for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip .
int-tr,

A: I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .
D: Yeah .
A: Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks .
A: It can actually be flat or it can be curved ,
A: um and then the different types of materials that you can use ,
-> A: um I don't think you can use them in a combination ,
B: Mm-hmm .
A: um but um
A: I could check back for you ,
A: but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination .
--> B: We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ?
-> A: Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine ,
A: but plastic , rubber , and wood ,
A: I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium .
B: Yeah .
A: They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium .
D: Hmm .
B: Mm 'kay .
A: Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use ,
A: but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing ,
B: Okay .
int-tr,

D: Okay .
B: So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
B: Um I mean what does everybody think about
B: Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ?
B: I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing ,
B: what are your thoughts on that ?
-> C: Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape .
C: Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit .
--> B: So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or
-> C: Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand .
-> B: So something quite curvy ?
B: Okay
B: um right okay .
B: Colour-wise I mean you made a re
B: uh was it you
B: or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it ,
B: was that
C: 
B: Whose
not,

A: 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it ,
C: Mm .
D: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .
D: Mm-hmm .
B: Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ?
D: Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ?
B: If you're holding it in your hand you could
-> A: That's a very unnatural motion to
--> B: Do you think ?
-> A: yeah .
-> B: Okay .
int-tr,

D: so that's
D: And it's much
D: Yeah .
D: So that's quite cool .
D: Uh personal preferences just some imagination ,
D: the raised symbols I thought were good ,
D: the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget ,
D: do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the
A: The L_C_D_
-> D: Yeah .
--> A: and the other stuff
A: uh , I think .
-> D: And the speech recognition ,
D: 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition ,
D: are we ?
B: But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more ,
B: but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new .
D: Uh-huh .
C: Okay .
D: Uh-huh . But our budget , we've
B: Uh yeah .
C: It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know .
ambig,

D: Yeah .
A: like so it would have a stem perhaps
A: and a
D: Maybe , yeah .
A: maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric .
C: Huh .
D: Like what's what's that ,
D: I don't even know the name of it ,
-> D: some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing .
D: I don't know the name of that .
--> A: So it'd look like this kinda .
-> D: Yeah , that's what I was thinking .
-> A: Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?
int-rec,

A: Yeah .
B: and the days when there is no sola sunlight
C: I'm I'm with uh Raj on that ,
B: Yeah . Yeah .
C: I think , you know ,
A: Okay , so probably just
D: 
-> C: I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window .
B: What we w
B: yeah .
--> D: But w like just normal light ?
B: I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea .
-> C: Oh that's true .
B: They can they can recharge it .
D: 
C: I mean I w I w uh
C: that idea that I thought
C: um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother
A: Mm .
-> D: And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ?
int-tr,

B: Uh
B: so the user interface will consist of two parts .
B: One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part .
B: Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space ,
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .
A: Okay .
B: Yeah ?
-> C: What do you mean by linear access then ?
--> B: Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .
-> C: Ah .
-> B: Um .
not,

A: To find it .
D: to find it .
A: Yeah .
D: Um and um
D: lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .
A: Yeah .
D: So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: Okay .
-> D: And uh remote controls are bad for
--> A: What is her other side ?
D: R_S_I_
D: um
-> D: I dunno .
B: Other side yeah , yo wa your wrist
A: 
B: It i can become painful you can have tendonditis .
-> A: Oh yeah ?
not,

A: 
B: 
C: I would say uh about eight months to have the first results .
A: 
A: Okay so i it's a bit long yeah .
C: Yeah .
C: I can
C: Um .
A: One month for the standard one with button .
-> C: Yeah .
--> A: Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ?
-> C: Yeah even .
C: I mean that this is really standard devices now .
C: Um eight .
C: For uh speech recognition .
-> A: Okay yeah .
A: Okay
A: so we can take this into account .
A: So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ?
int-tr,

D: Yeah ,
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
D: so
D: so a o one is appropriate ?
C: So
D: Or , more like a four .
B: No no , a little more in the middle .
-> B: No ,
C: I have
--> D: Three .
-> B: uh three or yeah .
C: I've
C: Yeah , two or three ,
C: because it's not just
C: uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty .
A: Okay .
C: But it's also designed for people of age above forty . So ,
-> D: Ah , exactly .
D: Exactly .
not,

C: 
B: 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not .
D: Yeah , yeah , not too flashy .
C: Yeah .
D: The remote control is made of soft material .
A: 
B: Um ,
C: Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft .
B: kinda soft , but but not this .
-> A: Yeah , but not too soft we have decided .
--> D: Three ?
B: Yeah .
-> A: Three , yeah .
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah yeah , easy to use ,
A: Easy to use . One .
B: very afford .
-> D: Easy to use ?
ambig,

B: Kinetic , one .
A: Kinetic , one ?
C: Yeah . Yeah .
B: Yeah .
A: Okay , solar cells , zero .
B: 
C: Yeah .
A: Okay , uh simple chip on print ?
C: Uh , n no .
-> D: No .
--> A: No ?
-> D: Advanced chip .
C: No .
-> A: No , advanced chip .
int-tr,

A: Yeah , tomorrow ?
D: Celebration .
A: Uh , the costs are within the budget .
A: Uh , the project is evaluated .
D: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
A: But , before we going to celebrate , uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer ,
A: because uh there must be some kind of end report .
-> A: I am busy with the end report right now .
A: You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh
--> D: What is an end report ?
-> A: Uh about all the meetings , what we have decided ,
D: Yeah .
A: a r r a report of this day .
D: Yeah , yeah .
A: Uh , that must be made ,
A: but I don't know ,
A: here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is
-> D: Oh , you ha you have ten minutes left , I uh read .
low,

B: And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?
C: Mm-hmm .
D: Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and
B: Contrast ,
B: brightness ,
D: Um yeah .
B: yeah ,
B: and anything else ?
D: Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions ,
-> D: um we didn't actually go through and specify the
--> B: Well of the designers what are they ?
-> D: Uh what can a T_V_ do ?
A: Okay things like um brightness , contrast ,
B: Uh-huh .
A: um maybe tuning the channels .
-> B: Okay channel tuning .
int-rec,

D: handy .
A: 
B: Well well there we go .
B: So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now .
B: So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore ,
B: and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing ,
B: which I think is fair enough ,
B: and so this is gonna be one big thing here .
B: Um .
-> C: Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ?
--> A: What do you mean by profile ?
D: Yeah .
-> C: Sort of flat as possible .
-> A: No .
low,

A: Sorry about that .
A: Okay .
A: So moving on .
A: Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro
A: and profit aim is fifty million Euro .
A: So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country .
A: Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
C: Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ?
-> A: Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .
C: Okay .
--> D: How many should we sell then ?
D: Um , a lot ,
-> A: Anyone a mathematician ?
-> D: two two two million ,
D: two mi no ,
D: more f four million .
not,

D: And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes .
D: I wish I'd had my camera .
D: So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here .
D: Yeah .
D: There you go .
B: Very nice .
A: Great .
D: Uh , what do we
D: Oh .
-> A: Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?
--> D: Yes I do .
-> A: Yea
A: Right .
D: 
A: So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard ,
B: Okay .
A: um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget ,
A: um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at ,
A: um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros .
A: And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um
A: we can like the price to create it will be significantly less .
not,

B: Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them
B: m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy .
B: So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really .
A: 
C: Mm .
D: 
B: You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it
B: right ?
B: Um solar cell is interesting .
-> B: May fail though , every here and there .
--> C: Would you have to leave it by the window ?
-> B: Mm . Yeah
-> C: yeah .
not,

A: Here you see this ?
A: This is on a I I
A: I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control ,
A: rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized
A: and they are not consistent th with other models and all .
B: Okay .
A: Okay , and second
A: as already discussed with William ,
-> A: we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top
C: Yeah .
--> D: Sorry what does that stand for ?
-> A: and g graphic user interface
B: Which means
A: basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever ,
D: Okay .
C: Yeah .
A: which is
C: If you if
C: yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen .
A: Like you have on a l uh
A: icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface .
low,

B: but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about .
B: But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards .
C: Yeah .
B: Right I'm going to wrap it up there .
C: Okay .
D: 
A: Fine .
-> B: I got a end meeting now message on my mo
D: 
A: Mm-hmm .
--> C: Did it ?
-> B: yeah
A: Yeah .
B: so . Um
int-tr,

B: um , I still don't have any information about user requirements .
D: 
B: I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh
A: Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting .
B: Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements .
A: Didn't we ?
A: Oh , okay .
B: I ha I ha I have the I have
-> A: Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi
A: Just
--> B: nothing .
-> A: no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only .
-> B: Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of .
int-tr,

A: but no , but it that's
C: 
A: that's our that's our killer feature .
B: It's just an it's just an idea .
D: 
A: That's our what makes it special .
B: It's a it's
-> C: Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station .
A: Yeah , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station .
B: True .
--> D: Is that so ? Was it it wasn't just a prototype ?
-> C: Yes , he have a picture of it .
B: Well uh I uh
B: Yeah , I dunno .
A: 
C: 
-> D: Exactly ,
C: 
D: I've never seen it in a store .
int-tr,

C: 
A: Or six , uh
D: Just start summarising now .
D: You can reply to the same message .
A: I haven't got message .
D: See summary , there . If you just reply to that one .
C: So there's no way to like predict what our
C: 'Cause we had a
C: we originally had a As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted .
-> C: It was fifty mil fifty million
--> D: Was it was it fifty or five ?
-> C: I don't remember .
C: But there's not a way to compute that ,
C: I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?
A: It gets handed over to another department .
-> D: Depends how much we sell .
int-tr,

A: You didn't put it in ? Or
C: That w .
A: it's not really English .
C: Let me check .
C: I know .
A: Uh kick off .
A: Oh working design I got it .
C: Yeah .
D: So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it .
-> A: Here you go .
--> C: Alright how do I uh skip pages ?
-> A: Just uh press uh
A: yeah . Yeah .
-> C: The keys yeah ?
not,

A: Mm-hmm .
C: But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote .
A: Design . Mm .
C: And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever .
B: Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions .
-> B: The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh
C: Yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: And maybe y
C: Experienced yeah .
--> D: But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ?
B: Na
-> B: I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display .
-> D: Yeah
A: Yeah .
D: like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ?
not,

D: 
B: Would that work ?
A: Get yourself in position .
B: Okay , so that's me again .
D: Ah .
B: Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery ,
-> B: a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches ,
B: if you remember that kind of
B: which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v
A: I don't think any of us remember the fifties .
--> C: Is it like a crank thing or something .
-> B: yeah , yeah .
B: It wouldn't be very fancy .
D: 
B: You can have a kinetic provision of energy ,
B: which is used on some watches these days .
B: So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work .
D: Mm .
B: Or you can use solar cells ,
B: but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but
-> C: Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .
low,

A: Uh-huh .
B: So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons .
B: So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case .
B: Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons .
B: So it's a constraint .
A: Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so
B: Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ?
B: If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons ,
B: if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons .
-> B: If that makes sense .
--> A: push buttons instead of the wheel ?
-> B: Yeah . .
C: If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway ,
C: it doesn't matter if it's double
C: I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ?
C: Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?
-> A: rubble double double .
not,

A: 
B: I'm gonna write that down .
D: so it's rea it's quite
C: 
A: 
D: it's quite like um user friendly
B: 
D: and also for different families , like like family use as well ,
D: so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think .
-> D: Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something .
--> A: So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different
-> D: Yeah .
-> A: so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the
int-rec,

C: Uh , the latest trends are soft things ,
C: you know , like uh I said in my presentation .
D: Yes .
C: Uh
C: But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue .
C: Something what also younger people want .
C: It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .
A: Okay .
B: Mm , three .
-> A: Me too . Three .
--> D: A three .
-> A: Yeah .
-> D: Okay .
D: So um , come back to the presentation now .
D: So , we find yourself there ,
D: and now we have to calculate an average rating .
D: So , we will do that .
int-tr,

A: Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro ,
A: and our profit aim is fifty million Euro .
A: We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia .
A: And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote .
A: Okay .
A: So we're gonna talk for a little while .
A: Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss .
A: Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote ,
-> A: anything that you can bring to the table for this project .
A: So .
--> C: Now ?
-> A: Yeah .
A: You wanna start us off ?
A: Anybody have anything to offer ?
C: 
B: Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote ,
B: right ?
A: Right .
B: One remote for everything .
-> C: And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ?
int-rec,

C: then again if you just
C: I guess I c
C: I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on .
D: Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C: You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or
B: Yeah .
D: Yeah , yeah .
A: But but imagine someone with s
-> B: My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .
C: I oh yeah ?
--> A: But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels .
B: 
A: Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to
C: 'Cause you'll have to like
D: Yeah .
-> B: They have to r wheel really fast .
C: but you can quickly s you can
A: Yeah .
B: But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels ,
C: Yeah .
D: Yeah , yeah , yeah .
B: at least on theirs .
C: Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be you
C: I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel ,
C: and um
ambig,

B: Didn't have enough data to actually
D: Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?
B: All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things .
B: It didn't give me any actual cost .
D: Okay . Right .
C: Hmm .
D: Mm .
B: Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk .
B: So I don't think it's that much of a problem .
-> B: Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .
--> A: What does chip on print mean ?
-> B: Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip ,
D: 
A: Uh-huh .
B: calculators too I think .
B: Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap .
A: Okay .
B: But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .
A: Right .
-> A: So , chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced .
B: Yeah .
low,

A: 
C: Well uh , shapes are curved and round .
D: 
C: Y y you get the picture .
C: And uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality .
C: Uh , so w well uh , firs
A: One one little question .
A: Um about the the material .
C: Yes .
-> C: Yeah .
--> A: Uh a soft material for a remote control ?
-> C: No , I'll I'll get to that .
-> A: Okay . Yeah .
not,

C: But , well you just take up all the space ,
C: and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used .
B: Okay .
A: But you prefer kinetic ?
C: So
C: I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery .
A: Okay .
C: I mean , if
A: Yeah , but you don't move a a remote control too much .
-> C: No , but uh d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you
--> A: And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh
-> C: Yeah , well uh actually it is .
-> A: Okay .
not,

A: Maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
B: Hey .
C: Hey .
C: That might be a next step .
A: There are numbers on it , so uh
D: Yeah , exactly .
A: 
-> D: Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition .
B: 
D: Uh , it's very innovative . Innovative .
--> A: So that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh
-> D: Yeah , like something .
D: You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak uh speech recognition and stuff .
-> A: Okay .
int-rec,

A: I think we have uh we have decided uh , okay .
D: Consensus .
A: Uh , little more .
D: Oh . Oh . I I have one thing left .
B: Oh .
A: Yeah .
D: Maybe for uh Jerome .
B: Yeah ? I'm listening .
D: Um , the views .
-> D: Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
--> A: Like a like a moat or s or something .
-> D: Yeah .
-> A: Yeah .
int-rec,

B: it also depends on the software on the on the television .
C: Yeah .
B: You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen .
A: Mm-hmm .
B: So s yeah let's take away the
C: Yeah
-> C: you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even ,
B: Yeah . Yeah .
C: if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself .
B: Right .
--> A: So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ?
-> C: Uh that is possible yeah .
B: Right . We may not need it .
B: There you go .
-> A: Well there we go .
int-rec,

D: I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones .
A: Yeah .
A: What about the settings of the T_V_ ?
A: Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway .
C: So uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh
A: So
D: Yeah .
C: we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design .
-> C: Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels
C: and then you can
--> B: On the screen , you mean ?
-> C: Yeah . Yeah b
-> B: Not on the control , but on the screen .
low,

B: Participant three .
B: Yes .
B: Okay .
A: Okay .
B: Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like
B: so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers .
B: Next , please .
B: Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television .
B: This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel ,
-> B: like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .
--> A: Nine what ? Nine channel uh switches ?
-> B: Pardon me ?
-> A: Nine channel switches ?
A: Is
low,

C: yeah .
A: No spats , that was good .
B: 
D: 
C: No .
A: Um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ?
A: Like the the pens , the whiteboard ,
B: 
A: I mean we used
-> B: Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff .
--> A: Are you a Mac person ?
-> B: No no I never touch Macs either .
D: 
B: I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .
A: Huh .
C: Hmm .
D: Which isn't very user-friendly though .
B: Yeah .
A: 
B: Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it .
B: So I have all these documents I can't use now .
not,

C: That's cool .
A: So uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling ,
D: Okay ?
D: Mm-hmm .
-> A: and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ?
A: Um , or if
C: 
D: 
A: is that a function we want in the remote ?
D: Um , I haven't been able to
--> C: Um , do you have trouble whistling ?
-> A: I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right .
-> C: Really ?
C: Ooh .
not,

D: Well
C: So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a
D: Mm .
C: or it looks like we're just cutting on the um
D: On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff .
C: I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it .
D: Mm-hmm , okay .
D: Okay , cool .
-> C: Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that ,
C: or maybe they'll send
--> B: About cost .
C: some information about that ,
C: about um what people ,
-> C: whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control .
-> B: Okay .
low,

C: I think the main thing is we look at the costs .
D: Yep .
A: Hmm .
C: And not too basic ,
C: not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .
D: Yeah .
D: But , thi i uh
D: This is with an L_C_D_ ? No ,
-> C: Not with an L_C_D_ .
D: not .
--> A: No , isn't .
-> C: No .
-> A: But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons .
A: Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .
ambig,

A: You have to
A: For the menu .
B: Yeah .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: One that way .
A: And one that way .
A: So
-> A: Then it depends on the cost .
A: S On and off .
D: 
--> C: But is it easy to use ?
C: When you have it on your left side ,
C: and
-> A: When it's not too big .
A: Just like a a phone .
B: Mm-hmm .
D: M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um
-> C: Separate , more separate , h yeah .
not,

A: And the buttons are on the next page .
A: So , depends on the cost .
A: So ,
C: Costs are okay .
A: um we have one minute .
B: .
D: 
D: One .
A: I think .
-> D: No .
--> A: No .
-> D: You have more .
-> A: More . Seven .
int-tr,

C: 
A: That's a very good elephant .
C: The back end of an elephant .
D: Oh my gosh ,
D: I'm never gonna be able to draw that well .
A: 'Kay , and you want to write up on there ,
A: it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal .
B: Um okay ,
B: it's big ,
-> B: it's got a great memory .
--> D: Does it ? Oh .
-> B: Supposed to have a great memory ,
B: we say an elephant never forgets .
A: Mm .
D: Mm .
B: And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me .
A: Okay . Wonderful , well done .
B: Nice animal .
A: Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ?
B: Okay .
A: And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ?
int-tr,

A: This one ?
D: Yeah , okay ,
D: thank you .
A: And Francine ?
B: Participant two .
A: You are number two ?
B: Yes .
B: No no , I'm three .
A: You're three .
-> B: I can make it full ?
--> A: Would you want it full full screen ?
-> B: Yes yes yes .
-> A: Mm-hmm ? Okay .
int-rec,

A: Mm-hmm .
A: 
B: bana sit
B: the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over
B: and um this is the remote itself ,
B: it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well .
B: We've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here
B: which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel
-> B: and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button
B: which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally .
--> A: What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?
-> B: This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th
-> A: Ah yeah yeah
A: an then you stop when you stop it stops .
low,

D: Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons .
D: Looks a bit
C: You want to have more functional buttons ?
D: Looks a bit puzzled
D: uh I dunno how to say that .
D: You the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not
C: You are not convinced .
C: Not not many , we we want to keep it simple .
C: So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case ,
-> C: that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .
--> D: And the volume button will will become
-> C: It's up to you , means .
C: Now that
A: Well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext .
C: Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .
B: Or can move between positions in the in the number .
C: That's right .
-> D: And what about people who want to use digits ?
A: Yeah .
D: Butto real buttons ?
not,

C: 
D: I find it quite cheap actually .
B: 
D: I dunno . If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in
A: Yeah ,
A: so the target price is for all Europe , or only for rich countries ?
A: It's more targeting U_K_ or
D: I don't know .
-> D: Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or
B: Uh
--> A: So this is selling costs , not production costs .
-> D: Yeah this is the the initial specifications .
B: Yeah . Yeah .
-> A: Yeah yeah sure .
A: Um
A: Five .
low,

B: this probably actually costs more than three
A: Yeah
B: if you
A: so let's put one here in the then instead of single
C: Okay . Okay .
A: oka all right .
B: Yeah .
-> A: So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .
C: Yeah .
C: That's right .
--> B: Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber
-> A: No ,
A: it's too
A: no .
D: Too expensive .
-> B: if you drop it ?
int-tr,

B: and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness
D: Mm-hmm .
D: Of the screen . Mm , mm-hmm .
B: of this uh picture .
B: We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button .
B: Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included .
B: Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible
B: so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel .
-> B: It will take the user to the previous and the next channel
B: so this is a swapping button .
--> D: The next channel in the numeric pattern , or
-> B: No , swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button .
D: Yeah , mm-hmm .
D: Mm .
-> D: Okay , okay .
ambig,

C: Yeah .
B: 
A: Um .
A: So that uh
A: I think financing was pretty simple .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
D: Okay , I'll take my file down so you can bring it up .
D: 'Kay should be able to get it now .
-> D: 'Kay , why don't you move just to the next slide right away .
--> A: You wanna go to the next slide ?
-> D: Yeah right away .
-> A: Okay .
int-rec,

D: Go ahead .
A: Yes it is . Mm-hmm .
D: I think that was my last slide , yeah . Um .
D: Mm okay .
D: And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard .
D: Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now ,
-> D: so if you put my last slide back up there .
A: Oh .
D: I'm sorry
D: I've um forgot to do that , um .
--> A: Why ? Wh why you need that up ?
-> D: Hmm ?
D: Well because I can't remember what I put on there .
D: Okay .
C: 
D: Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here .
-> A: I think you can make it there .
int-tr,

B: 'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating .
A: Oh my bad .
A: 
D: Oh that's fine .
B: Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this .
C: Help me .
B: We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional .
B: Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip .
-> B: Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .
C: 
--> D: What exactly is a smart chip ?
-> B: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions .
C: Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ?
C: Is that gonna push us over our production costs ?
B: I wouldn't think so ,
B: 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap .
A: Okay .
A: Ready ?
B: Um yep ,
low,

A: And we wanna keep um
A: I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down .
A: Correct ,
A: because people only use ten percent .
D: Yeah .
A: 'Kay .
-> A: Hey , what else ?
C: Um .
A: Um .
C: 
--> B: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ?
-> A: I think so .
A: What do you
D: Sure , yeah .
C: 
A: A finding kind of device or
B: And
D: I need
D: we we need a like homing device .
-> B: like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?
not,

A: So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind ,
C: Right , yeah .
D: Yeah .
A: or no menu buttons .
A: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers
A: Yeah .
C: 
D: Yeah .
A: Um can we go back to
-> A: I'm gonna look really quickly back at those
--> C: Two examples .
-> A: examples
-> C: Yeah .
int-rec,

A: But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably .
D: Yeah .
A: It's what , from my experience .
B: But isn't it
D: I don't know .
D: Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television .
A: Okay .
A: But we gonna
-> B: It's only for television , I thought . Not
D: Yes .
--> A: Oh , it is only for televis
-> B: I thought it was only for television .
B: So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ .
D: Yes , it is only for television , but uh
A: So wha what
D: Well
-> A: What wha what uh what document
int-tr,

D: 
B: But I'll just draw a different kind of dog .
D: Yep .
B: M my favourite animal is my own dog at home .
B: Um
B: That doesn't really look like him , actually .
B: He looks more like a pig , actually .
B: Ah well .
-> D: I see a dog in there .
C: 
--> B: Do you ?
-> D: Yep .
-> B: Oh that's very good of you .
int-tr,

B: Uh if you
B: That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .
A: Okay .
B: So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling .
B: Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons .
B: Colour changeable .
B: Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up .
B: We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .
D: Okay .
-> B: And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it .
--> A: And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ?
B: So when you pre
-> B: Yeah .
-> A: How do you want to implement that ?
A: Just on the
B: We're going to implement .
A: Maybe on the second level as well ?
not,

C: Are w are we changing uh
C: Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ?
C: Or n no back light ?
D: Slide panel ?
C: Yeah ?
B: Mm . Not needed .
A: No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers
B: Yeah , not needed I think .
A: and uh
-> C: And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too ?
--> D: Oh , you mean th this here ?
A: That as well , yeah .
B: Yeah .
-> C: Yeah .
A: Yeah , but that's unnecessary .
B: What do I think is necessary necessary item ?
-> D: It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , it lights up .
D: That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable .
low,

A: It's hard to say .
A: But maybe we have to um
A: Yeah , okay .
A: Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal .
B: Yeah .
A: We get different ones , that's all .
A: So you can put a recharger in it as well .
C: 
-> A: But this is expensive , the sample speaker .
C: Yeah .
--> B: This ?
-> A: Yeah .
C: Yeah , it's four .
D: Four . It's four Euros .
-> B: Oh , them .
B: Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or
low,

A: Mm .
B: 'Cause this is single curve ,
B: this is curved on both sides .
B: So double-curve .
C: No ,
C: I think it means double curved as in um
D: Like an S_ shape .
-> C: like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward .
D: Okay .
C: Okay , I might be wrong though .
--> B: Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side .
-> C: I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape .
B: Hmm . Hmm .
D: Okay .
A: 
C: A curvature is like the this case .
B: Maybe .
A: 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right .
D: Okay .
C: Yeah ,
A: got two of them
low,

B: because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two .
A: 
C: Oh I see .
A: Yeah round it up to two .
B: Yeah .
D: Okay , yeah .
B: So where were the trends .
A: So trends .
A: Can you explain what you want us to write there ?
-> B: Sorry ?
--> A: How it how conforms to the current trends ?
-> B: Yeah , again the the fashion trends ,
B: this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: 
D: Okay .
B: Uh .
D: Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um ,
D: well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know ,
C: 
D: so I would actually give it a three .
not,

C: but technology is twice as important .
C: And what was even more important ?
D: Uh the fancy look and feel .
C: Okay .
C: So
C: that's the most important thing for our customers .
D: Yes . Apparently .
A: Okay ,
A: Roo ,
-> B: Yeah .
--> A: could you do your presentation ?
-> B: Mm-hmm .
B: Well ,
B: I don't ha really have much to add ,
B: um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um
-> A: Okay , well
A: it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .
not,

C: Yeah yes .
A: Yeah .
C: 
A: I dunno I dun I dun One each
D: 
A: . But , yeah , .
B: Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially ,
D: Yeah .
B: but it's seven inches .
-> B: But I I think we can we can cut it .
--> D: You can cut the T_F_T_ screen .
A: Let's go .
C: 
-> B: Yeah , no no problem ,
B: because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth .
A: So let's cut the T_F_T_ .
B: So
D: 
B: Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen .
C: Mm .
-> D: Okay ,
D: so
ambig,

B: We could use a basic battery ,
B: but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well .
B: And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally .
B: There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago .
B: A bit out of date .
B: Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .
A: Um
A: What is a hand-powered dynamo ?
-> B: Um , where you manually charge up the power .
B: Like you wind up something .
--> A: Just every , every once in a while ?
-> B: Sorry ?
-> A: Just every once in a while or constantly ?
not,

D: Okay .
A: Yeah .
C: But um
C: I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway ,
C: to make it more simplistic .
A: Yeah .
D: Mm-hmm .
C: But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points ,
C: as in
-> C: just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe .
--> A: What do you mean ?
C: Like
-> C: I can't think of an example ,
C: but
C: Sort of like little pictures rather than
-> A: Oh yeah ,
A: like how the buttons
low,

A: Yeah um
D: Okay .
A: Alright ,
A: given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions .
A: So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again .
D: There you go .
D: 
D: Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the
D: okay .
-> B: But I have now .
--> A: But it's still around right ?
-> B: Yeah . Uh , hopefully
-> A: Okay .
not,

B: Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person .
B: So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe
D: Yeah .
B: cut out some a lot of your market .
D: I dunno
D: I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls .
C: Well maybe it could be a universal design .
D: Sorry ?
-> C: A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands .
D: Yeah .
--> B: Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ?
C: Yeah ?
-> C: That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand ,
D: Yeah .
C: but but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?
D: Sorry ?
C: The first and the third point , they are clashing .
-> B: Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand .
low,

C: So this was the
C: my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control .
B: You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button
C: Yeah .
A: 
B: like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing
C: Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up .
A: Okay .
B: Yeah .
-> C: So these are the slight problems .
--> A: So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?
C: Because
-> C: yeah
C: the reason is that if we go into the market means
C: though I don't have much idea ,
C: but as he the uh Marketing Expert presentation was
D: I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it .
B: Actually I'm not so sure
C: So if we go with just the
D: I'm sure .
B: because I'm the
B: you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control .
int-rec,

A: Okay , so not too fast writing .
A: Um
A: you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button .
A: It's quite the same .
A: Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file .
A: So do not m make a new file .
A: Just use this one uh during the day .
A: Um you can use the eraser to make something go away .
B: But we all use the same white-board file
-> A: Yes .
--> B: So we can work together on it while we're
B: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?
-> A: Yeah .
A: Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings .
-> B: Yeah , okay .
not,

A: So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um
C: Yeah .
C: 
B: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do ,
B: wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .
C: Mm-hmm .
-> B: It just should change the T_V_'s state .
A: Okay .
B: So that's it .
B: Um but furthermore
--> C: And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?
-> B: Yeah . Yeah , with buttons .
-> C: Or are there any o other controls ?
C: Are there only any other cont
not,

A: I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours ,
A: so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that .
A: Okay . Um .
A: So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions .
A: Um , yeah . Do Let's
B: 
A: I guess we should yeah make some
A: kind of brainstorming ,
-> C: Like in terms of
A: see what we can
--> D: How it looks or
-> C: how it looks , or like what it does ?
A: wha what um
A: well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group
C: Okay .
A: and I dunno the the s
A: the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .
C: Yeah . Okay .
C: So
C: Is our target group then people
C: so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?
int-rec,

C: Yeah .
C: Then it can live anywhere .
A: Yeah .
B: 
D: Okay .
C: Yeah .
D: For the
D: so you have that button ,
D: that so there's
-> D: is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?
--> B: Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ?
D: Are we just having a radio ?
-> D: On the phone .
-> B: Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me ,
low,

A: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
-> A: I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .
C: Okay .
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
B: .
C: I'm thinking we could
C: if if we're hav So ba
C: I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .
--> B: And they're re-programmable aren't they ?
B: You can put on your songs and then put on a different set ,
-> A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
-> B: that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .
not,

B: like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner ,
B: but I don't know about
B: uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is .
D: Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing .
D: I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people
D: because they are more open to new devi new devices
B: To fruit ?
D: and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was
D: was was able to
-> D: to buy a a n a cooler remote control .
--> B: But is it uh is fruit cool ?
-> D: What ?
A: That's a question .
D: What ?
-> B: Is fruit cool ?
int-tr,

A: So you're three ?
B: Yeah .
A: And it's this one .
B: Yep .
A: Go for it .
B: Yep .
B: Okay . So .
B: S next uh slide .
B: Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit ,
-> B: um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control .
--> C: But it's just a speaker right ?
B: It's
-> B: no ,
B: what it is , it's it's very
-> C: It's not a microphone .
int-tr,

A: Yeah yeah .
B: but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh
A: So it it's c uh it it
D: Yeah but you can u
A: it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh
B: Completely pointless yeah .
A: yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view .
B: Yeah .
-> B: Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control .
A: Okay .
--> D: Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ?
B: 
-> B: Well yeah , that's the thing ,
B: if
B: you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination ,
B: you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing ,
B: not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it .
A: Yeah yeah .
A: So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: So
B: Yeah , that would be some development work .
not,

A: Yeah .
B: I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like
D: No ,
D: I mean in a
A: Yeah .
A: It's not re it
B: like with a banana you can have
A: you you think it's really fancy and fun ?
A: You think that young people that are
-> D: I'm sure it's fun .
--> A: Yeah . More than a banana ?
-> D: But banana is not so handy ,
C: Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum .
B: Well
D: I think that's handier .
B: But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top
B: and just
A: Yeah .
B: roll it back and forth like that ,
-> A: It's kind it's kind of it's more uh
int-tr,

B: Yeah .
A: Oh , just the switch ,
C: Remotes don't have power on off switch .
A: no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ .
B: Yeah .
A: Uh so you
C: Okay .
C: S no , that'll be controlled by the
D: What a
-> C: those buttons'll be there already , yeah .
--> B: Where ?
-> C: Means on the remote .
A: On the side .
C: Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons .
B: Okay .
C: They are not going to cost you much ,
C: everything is in-house
C: and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this .
-> B: Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote
low,

B: yeah .
A: You received something
B: I haven't chec
C: Yeah .
C: You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .
A: Hmm .
C: Says
C: Yeah .
-> C: It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions .
C: But I guess it could be
--> A: And could it be adapted ?
-> C: I guess it's possible .
C: I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command .
-> A: Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?
not,

D: Yeah that's why
D: Yeah
A: Has it ?
D: that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .
A: Yeah .
A: I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative .
B: Mm-hmm .
D: Innovative . Mm .
A: So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept .
-> C: How do we make it look cool is the question .
--> A: Cool , fancy ?
-> C: Yeah .
-> A: We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable .
low,

B: bit complicated .
B: It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ?
D: I'm all in a knot now .
A: 
D: Okay .
B: Right .
A: 
D: Um . So I can I can say already ,
D: I dunno whether this is for good or for bad
-> D: but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things .
--> B: Oh , like overlap between what you said ?
-> D: Yeah , yeah .
-> B: Oh well , for all you know that that'll happen .
low,

D: this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there .
D: We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together .
A: Mm-hmm .
A: Okay ,
A: so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan , okay ,
A: a discussion with uh
D: Certainly by the next meeting .
A: By next meeting , okay that will be great .
A: Uh Okay ,
-> A: so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ?
--> C: What is the goal of the project ?
-> A: Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed , okay ,
D: 
A: so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting .
C: 
D: I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do .
D: We have to define exactly what our product is , from uh
A: Yes ,
A: so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ?
D: From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee ,
D: is that right ?
not,

A: Yep .
A: Okay .
A: So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah .
B: And we and we have a single-curved uh
A: Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ?
B: Uh I think that
D: We've got a we've got a curve and a droop .
A: We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur
D: I don't know whether that .
-> B: It's single-curved ,
--> A: You think ?
A: Okay
-> B: yeah .
-> A: I'm convinced .
A: But we save one Euro that way , yeah ?
A: So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four .
int-tr,

B: 
A: Boring ,
C: 
A: it's not fun to use a remote .
D: No .
C: Mm .
-> D: Black , all black .
B: Well .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: So ,
--> C: Black colours .
-> D: yeah .
A: Well
A: maybe we should try to make it fun .
D: Mm-hmm .
-> C: They use batteries
C: and batteries
C: uh and poor signal .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Yeah .
C: Uh .
int-rec,

D: They're a special colour .
A: uh okay .
D: Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented .
A: Are they ?
A: Oh , right .
C: And then s
D: And , they're a special material .
C: yeah .
-> A: Mm . Well , we're under cost then .
A: Alright .
--> C: We're over ?
-> A: No , we're under .
B: Grand .
D: We're under .
A: Twelve point five is our limit .
C: Okay .
-> C: Oh , I see .
low,

C: Yeah , yeah .
A: And from ten to ten channels here .
C: Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty
C: and this one , t one two three four five six , like this .
A: Okay .
C: Uh there's different scale ,
C: so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc
D: Okay .
D: But this this has to stay on the table , right ?
-> C: Mm-hmm .
--> D: This has to stay on the table .
B: In fact on a flat place
-> C: I i this is just a base .
C: You can just
B: You can
-> D: Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it
int-rec,

D: I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about .
D: It's under evaluation .
A: Right .
D: Alright .
D: Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask ,
D: is it easy to use , is it fashionable uh
D: yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them .
A: Mm .
C: Feel good meaning what ?
-> D: Like does it feel good , like
--> C: Physically ,
-> D: yeah , physically .
A: Right .
-> C: okay .
C:
low,

D: And that's it .
A: Op mm 'kay .
B: Okay .
A: Great . Great presentation .
A: Ready ?
C: Okay
C: hang on .
A: 'Kay .
-> C: See if it's there .
C: 
--> A: Which one is it ?
-> C: I don't know .
C: Hang on .
A: 
C: Interface concepts ,
C: no ?
-> A: Interface concepts new .
low,

D: because the soft latex definitely is squishy .
D: That's in .
D: Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic .
A: Right . Right .
A: Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ?
B: How complicated
B: Are we gonna go with the voice activated
C: Yeah .
A: I don't think we should do voice ,
-> A: I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know .
--> C: A tracker , yeah .
A: could we
-> A: Yeah .
D: 'Cause that uh what it type of , yeah ,
D: for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like ,
A: Hmm .
D: because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time .
A: Right .
D: So uh
B: Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing .
D: Ooh .
A:
low, could be int_rec

A: 'Kay .
D: But we definitely
D: If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled .
A: Mm .
D: Yeah ,
D: like on the side of it .
B: Well , if it's just up and down
D: Oh if it's just up and down .
C: But is that for
-> B: Volume or channel .
--> C: Which ?
-> B: I don't know .
D: Well , you could do some on both sides .
-> C: Do we have both sides ?
low,

A: Yeah .
B: So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea .
A: If we want it to be visible and
A: Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ?
C: Yeah .
A: But those are plastic , right ?
C: Yeah .
A: They're not titanium .
-> A: I kind of like that look .
A: Uh but , or if it was really
--> B: For our base one ?
-> A: Yeah , for the base
A: or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool .
D: Yeah ,
A: What are your thoughts ?
D: or like a gun-metal grey ,
A: Gun-metal gray .
D: 'cause then it combines the silver and the black .
A: There you go , gun-metal gray .
C: 
C: I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button .
low,

C: Two , maybe .
D: Two .
A: Yeah .
D: Okay , two .
D: So size and weight .
C: Yeah , yeah .
D: Is it the the the effective size and weight that the
D: Is it uh real size , real weight ?
D: Or Because it
-> C: Yeah , it's size al almost
--> D: Size is going to be that , yeah ?
-> C: Yeah ,
C: because it is
D: Uh , and and
C: The weight will be bit lighter .
C: We will s We use titanium .
B: Sure ,
B: without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .
A: Mm-mm .
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah . Yeah .
ambig,

C: huh .
C: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working .
B: On off ?
D: 
D: Yeah .
C: We can adapt only one switch ,
C: suppose here like we can make two switches
C: and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .
-> B: I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a
C: Two .
--> D: Three buttons you mean ?
-> B: like three mental states ,
A: Three option .
D: Ah .
B: yeah you know what I mean ,
C: 
B: we can just make it uh
A: 
C: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
A: Um .
low,

D: Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit .
A: Yeah , I think so .
A: Maybe if it's
D: Not too much then , bu alright .
A: no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants .
A: So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either .
D: Yes .
A: Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products .
-> A: Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design .
A: Okay , something else nice to know .
--> B: But what's our slogan ?
-> A: Sorry ?
A: Yeah , you will have to look that up .
-> B: The slogan uh
B:
ambig,

B: 
D: Yeah , okay .
B: It should be possible .
A: Uh I I think it's a great idea .
B: I think it's a good idea .
D: Yeah .
A: S some kind of be
B: To make a base or something ?
-> A: I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays .
D: Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah .
--> C: Yes , but is that handy ?
-> A: Well , I well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one .
B: It's it's it's it's
A: And uh you can always find your remote control up
-> C: But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries .
int-tr,

D: That this will be a crux .
C: Yeah .
D: So that was the marketing uh presentation .
D: I had only one document left .
C: And shall I go first ?
-> B: Yeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind .
C: So I
B: That's
D: So kind of this
A: Yeah yeah sure . No .
--> C: Yeah ?
-> B: Do you want to go first ? Okay .
D: So a k a small example .
B: Yeah .
D: Kind of this this look .
B: 
D: Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours
B: Yeah .
D: I dunno .
D: Just made a quick design .
B:
int-rec,

A: That would be the back .
B: I'm
B: The back .
D: Yeah .
A: Back and okay .
D: Back and okay .
B: Back and okay yeah .
B: Uh
A: You did read the minutes I wrote ?
-> B: What ?
--> A: You did read the minutes I wrote ?
-> B: A little bit I think but not not everything w
C: I
-> A: Oh okay
A: 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So
low,

D: Yeah .
A: That's singly curved .
C: Yeah . Yeah ?
A: Okay .
D: That should be nice .
A: Well we could make a compromise between that .
A: But I don't know if it's worth the effort .
C: A compromise between what ?
-> A: Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public .
D: So s
--> C: This , this would be uh single curved uh ?
-> A: Mm-hmm .
D: Yeah there's only in in this dimension .
A: Yeah .
D: Like this . So curvy or not .
C: Yeah .
A: Also .
-> C: Yeah . Exactly . Exactly .
int-rec,

A: Yeah .
D: but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high .
A: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
D: So uh yeah .
D: That would be a nice uh nice device I guess .
-> B: And which which colour should uh should I give the the display ? Uh
B: Or
A: Who ?
--> D: I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ?
-> B: Yeah . Yeah .
-> D: Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive .
low,

D: Yeah .
D: Well it works pretty well .
B: Yeah .
A: 
D: And then time was up .
A: Uh not yet .
D: Uh
D: .
C: Do you get a pop-up if we
-> A: Yeah within five minutes yeah .
--> D: That you have five minutes left or
C: Alright .
-> A: Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out .
-> D: So something like this .
low,

A: They have LEDs but they have a colour .
C: Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind .
D: Yeah ?
C: They will see one of each as grey .
D: Yeah .
-> C: But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same .
A: 
B: Okay .
D: Okay .
C: I think .
--> D: So red buttons are okay ?
-> C: I think so .
B: Okay .
B: That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons .
A: You can make them red .
A: Yeah . But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light .
-> D: How do you mean ?
D: Yeah .
not,

D: Yeah .
A: Good luck .
C: Alright .
C: Thanks .
D: Yeah .
D: Alright so that's uh
A: So I
-> A: uh make new page and uh be creative .
D: Yeah .
C: Alright .
--> B: But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ?
-> A: Yeah you have uh
C: Thirty minutes .
A: thirty minutes .
-> B: Okay .
int-tr,

D: Oh . It hasn't
C: . It doesn't aim so well .
B: 
D: Okay but the screen is a bit lower
D: because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen .
B: Yeah , then it's
D: So there's a layer of rubber on the side .
C: Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely .
A: 
-> D: So no flipping but just
--> B: No flipping or
A: No flipping ?
-> D: no .
-> B: you wanted the flipping so
int-tr,

C: Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if
C: When it's on , yeah , it's turned on ,
D: Hmm ?
A: You say you double click on the
C: It automatically has the the programme and the volume function ,
D: Yeah .
C: but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some
D: Yeah .
C: Of you
-> C: Or you double click it .
--> D: But but how do you change from volume to channel ?
-> C: No because it has four arrows ,
A: 
C: right ?
A: No , not anymore .
B: No .
-> D: No .
not,

D: Yeah .
D: Mm-hmm . Oh
A: Yeah .
D: Oh Alright .
D: Word document , the
A: Yeah .
-> D: Yeah we have to count them .
A: That
A: Count them .
D: Uh
--> A: Add them ? Or
-> D: Yeah just add them and then uh divide them .
-> A: Could somebody start calculator ?
low,

C: Okay special colour . We do have special colour .
C: Does it mean uh that
B: Yeah red is already a special colour , I think . So
B: It's not very special , but uh
D: Yeah .
C: Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ?
B: Yeah .
C: Purdy .
-> B: Just uh put the purple uh purple on it .
D: Yeah . Some some big dots .
--> C: Purple ?
-> B: That's trendy .
D: Yeah .
-> C: Yeah yeah .
C: Oh no my remote has acne .
int-tr,

D: Yeah , especially if f f if you see uh you se
B: And
D: you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess .
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah . Definitely .
A: Okay and was that due to my leadership ?
B: Yeah yeah yeah .
A: 
D: 
-> C: Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that
--> A: Yeah ?
-> C: Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing .
B: Yeah .
D: Yeah .
-> A: That okay ?
A: Okay .
A: Um was there uh enough room for creativity ?
int-tr,

B: Yeah .
A: but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it ,
A: I don't know .
C: No , no .
A: I think it's more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works ,
A: but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said .
C: Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press .
A: I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M
C: Uh , some
-> C: N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten
--> A: Th won't work wi with uh
-> C: No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals .
-> A: to have that special button .
ambig,

B: Yeah . True , yeah .
D: I was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh
A: A th a three .
D: oh , yeah , that's true .
D: You agree on the two ?
B: Yeah .
C: Yes .
A: I i uh when you compare to the
D: Great .
-> D: Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .
--> A: Uh uh what's the difference with
-> D: Uh , I copied that one .
B: 
D: Well , uh forget that .
-> A: Okay .
ambig,

B: Yeah , that's no option , that's no option .
A: Okay , we'll we'll just
A: okay .
A: But then still , when we there's no room for a docking station or something .
A: Tha w Le
A: let's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements .
-> A: We'll give the buttons special colour .
A: We'll give them a special form .
A: Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing ,
A: because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess .
--> B: A special colour , why a special colour ?
-> A: Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings .
-> B: But wha what s what special ?
int-tr,

A: well I could see the other email that they sent you ,
A: um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa
A: Okay so your basic components are buttons ,
C: Right .
B: Mm .
A: okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel ,
D: Mm-hmm .
A: okay there's an L_C_D_ display ,
D: 
-> A: um I think these are quite standard things .
--> D: They're standard , aren't they ?
-> A: No
A: um they're
A: well in the sense that these are all the options available for you .
A: I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later .
D: Yeah .
A: Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks .
A: It can actually be flat or it can be curved ,
A: um and then the different types of materials that you can use ,
A: um I don't think you can use them in a combination ,
B: Mm-hmm .
ambig,

A: Okay .
D: and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something .
B: Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone .
A: Okay .
D: Like a phone , yeah yeah .
B: Okay cool .
D: Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week .
B: Yeah .
D: We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days .
-> A: Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch
--> D: But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ?
B: Mm .
-> A: um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it .
-> D: Right .
int-tr,

C: You turn it on your control possessed s .
B: I know .
B: Um unless an a I mean if you
B: also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ?
B: Would we put that on the inside or
C: Um
A: Do we need an L_C_D_ display ?
A: What what's the functionality of that ?
B: It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought .
-> A: Yeah but the question is what are we using it
--> D: What would it achieve ?
-> A: what would we what would we achieve from it ?
A: Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a
-> D: Well
D: L_C_ well I'd
D: when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about .
D: And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings .
D: So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is .
int-tr,

D: you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that ,
C: Okay .
D: so that's
D: And it's much
D: Yeah .
D: So that's quite cool .
D: Uh personal preferences just some imagination ,
D: the raised symbols I thought were good ,
D: the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget ,
-> D: do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the
--> A: The L_C_D_
-> D: Yeah .
-> A: and the other stuff
A: uh , I think .
low,

C: Magic man .
A: So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control .
A: Um this is what they sent me .
A: 'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose .
C: 
A: Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside ,
C: Mm-hmm .
A: um
A: and there's a a chip , a processor ,
-> A: the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons ,
--> C: So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ?
A: and ch
-> A: Right ,
A: it's very
A: they're very cheap remote .
A: This remote costs nothing , you know .
A: Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier ,
A: which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps ,
A: and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light ,
A: which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end ,
D: Mm-hmm .
C: Right .
low,clarifying word chip

D: 'Cause um it could
D: Yeah .
C: Um don't wanna sort of overkill .
D: Especially with yellow .
D: Mm . I dunno .
A: Hmm .
C: 'Cause I mean like uh if we
C: I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ?
C: Do we want to go for buttons at all ,
-> C: do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ?
--> D: Then you put it in the fruit bowl ?
A: 
A: They can work from a
-> C: Yeah ,
C: you know , and then you just tal
C: I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly .
A: You don't have to hold it .
A: Yeah .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: 
D: 
A: I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers ,
C: Um .
not,

B: So I think it should be a package in that case .
B: Uh
B: so the user interface will consist of two parts .
B: One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part .
B: Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space ,
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .
A: Okay .
-> B: Yeah ?
--> C: What do you mean by linear access then ?
-> B: Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .
-> C: Ah .
low,

A: Maybe you can send it to me by email .
A: Just to participant one .
A: At AMI .
D: Mm-hmm .
D: Yeah , I can do that .
A: I will try to show it to everyone ,
A: that would be more comfortable .
D: Okay .
D: Um .
-> A: You send it ?
--> D: It's participant one ?
-> A: Yeah .
A: Uh this is this email .
B: I'm designing the user interface .
-> D: Okay .
D: You can uh .
int-tr,

C: Let's say that
C: um
C: something like that ,
C: which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that .
C: Push button or a L_C_D_ .
C: After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip .
-> C: So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component .
C: And so what we
C: for for myself this
C: for for us this is quite easy .
--> A: U_C_ is the central unit ?
-> C: Yeah .
-> A: Okay yeah .
low,

A: Yeah , the the thing we saw .
D: Yeah .
A: Okay , just saw .
D: Okay , one .
D: The remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
A: Yeah . Seven ?
D: 
D: Seven is false .
B: 
-> A: Uh , true .
--> D: Yeah , b one or
A: Sorry .
-> A: Yeah , one I think .
-> D: Most true ?
ambig,

D: Four ?
B: Uh
D: Fi
B: K yeah .
A: So , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing .
D: I
B: Fo fo yeah fo five is .
D: Ah , I I I think five .
D: It's it's it doesn't really make a lot of
-> C: Well , then uh then I'll go for four .
--> D: Four ?
-> C: Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false .
B: Yeah , okay , you're right .
C: Uh ,
-> D: Yes , but five is between four and six .
int-tr,

B: kinda soft , but but not this .
A: Yeah , but not too soft we have decided .
D: Three ?
B: Yeah .
A: Three , yeah .
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah yeah , easy to use ,
A: Easy to use . One .
B: very afford .
-> D: Easy to use ?
--> A: Yeah , can it be zero ?
C: Well , I don yeah , it is kind of
-> D: Top easy to use ?
D: It's it's not the most easy to use
C: It
B: No ,
C: No . Uh
B: you can do two , because um
D: It can be easier .
B: it can be easier .
C: It could yeah .
D: Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest .
not,

A: Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things ,
D: 
B: Yeah , and it's it's not very precise .
A: and that's the
B: We're trying to m to
D: Yeah ,
D: like when you do this .
B: Yeah , it may um
B: Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah .
-> B: Smaller .
--> D: Smaller ?
-> B: Yeah , smaller .
B: Just like when you're writing on a letter .
A: Yeah , but that's not th the the you
A: when you at a foreign audience , you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small .
B: No ,
B: a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one .
B: It's uh th it it
B: Yeah , uh we had more problems even here
B: when we trying to draw these buttons , it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh
A: Yeah .
low,

B: Mm .
B: Mm-hmm .
D: so instead we've um
D: this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one ,
D: very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm
D: um button .
C: Mm 'kay .
D: Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .
A: And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ?
-> A: the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .
--> C: Where are they ?
-> A: Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ?
-> C: Ah , right .
A: Okay 'cause
C: Great .
not,

A: The twelve buttons that you see there .
B: Twelve buttons .
D: That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so
B: Yeah .
A: Functionally you're gonna have to intercept
A: So four is a good estimate for
B: Do you think ?
A: Yeah ,
A: so you can't actually cut
-> A: It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .
--> B: Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons ,
B: how can it be something in between ?
-> A: It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: Mm .
C: Mm-hmm .
-> B: Okay
B: well we have point three to get rid of somewhere .
not,

A: Right .
C: You're dragging a you have a tail .
A: Oh my gosh , this is disastrous .
A: Sorry about that .
A: Okay .
A: So moving on .
A: Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro
A: and profit aim is fifty million Euro .
A: So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country .
-> A: Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
--> C: Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ?
-> A: Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .
C: Okay .
D: How many should we sell then ?
D: Um , a lot ,
A: Anyone a mathematician ?
D: two two two million ,
D: two mi no ,
D: more f four million .
B: Two million .
D: Four million .
low,

A: what does that stand for , I_D_ ,
B: Yeah I think so .
A: yeah
A: um is going to be looking more into the working design .
A: So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing .
A: The
A: something ,
A: what is the U_I_ ?
B: User .
-> C: That's me .
--> A: Yeah , what does it stand for again ?
-> C: Uh , User Interface design .
-> A: User Interface Designer .
A: So that's gonna be
A: more technical .
A: I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w
low,

B: And not only that .
B: Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell .
B: Um I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic ,
B: rubber , as well .
B: Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls .
B: So it's pretty squishy .
D: Spongy ?
B: That would that would serve that purpose .
-> B: Um we could also use wood , or titanium .
C: 
--> A: What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ?
D: 
C: 
-> B: Oh fya
D: 
B: I don't have an information on that .
B: However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it .
A: 
B: It certainly is an expensive material ,
B: I'm aware of that ,
A: 
B: but I was given an okay .
D:
not,

D: it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in .
C: Mm .
D: If we flip open ,
D: now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display ,
D: you seen those ?
B: No .
D: And they kind of respond to the turn of your body .
D: Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing .
-> B: We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
C: Um .
--> D: They don't look at themselves ?
D: Just a thought .
-> B: Well it's a remote control ,
B: you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_
D: Yeah .
-> D: I know what you mean ,
D: it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph
C: 
D: it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay .
B: Yeah ,
B: no , no .
D: trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much
int-tr,

B: And you could
B: yeah .
D: Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging ,
B: Okay .
C: 
A: Mm .
D: we've deci seem to have decided on that ,
-> D: did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?
A: Mm .
C: Well you cou um .
--> B: Do you want like a back-up ?
-> D: No ,
D: one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries
D: 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ?
C: K no
C: the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
D: I oh I see .
D: Right , okay , got you .
C: So it's a lot smaller ,
C: so it would
D: Got you on that okay ,
int-rec,

C: and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more ,
C: but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros .
A: Twelve and a half .
C: Ah yeah .
A: Actually
D: Yeah .
B: Yeah , production cost .
C: I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one .
B: 
-> C: You see uh a covers , which can be
--> A: What are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so
B: 
-> C: Um , I don't know . Um
D: 
-> A: But it's actually kind of uh
B: I
A: well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj
C: Yes .
D: Yep .
A: You know the the cartoonish Alessi kind of design .
ambig,

A: m but what what i so what i but do you think we should
B: Yeah , I don't know .
B: Uh , uh I i if it's it's a simple p
A: We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . So
B: No , that that's right ,
C: No uh um
B: and uh I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it .
B: Kind of L_C_D_ or something or
-> C: Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions .
D: Yeah , I guess .
--> B: But how does it display then ?
B: W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ?
-> C: Uh , then you push a button .
C: The title and the information about the programme .
-> B: About that programme ?
int-tr,

A: It's come in under budget .
D: 's great .
C: Yeah .
A: So that's a definite one .
C: That was great .
D: Yeah .
A: Amount of buttons .
D: Like the amount of buttons ,
D: 'cause people like a lot le like
-> A: Contains only the necessary buttons .
--> D: So it's a one ?
-> A: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
-> D: Um criteria six .
D: R_S_I_ is it good against ?
int-rec,

D: Or below
A: Yeah below forty .
D: because that's pretty relevant .
A: Mm-hmm .
D: I thought I read a
A: Our current customers are in the age group forty plus .
D: Yeah ?
-> A: And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty .
D: Below ?
D: Okay well
--> B: But where did you get uh that information ?
D: that's that's in the newsfla
-> A: That's in a newsflash .
D: okay that's a good to know .
A: 
B: Okay .
D: Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features .
B: Yeah .
D: I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition .
D: Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are .
D: So I think we can build that in .
D: Um
int-tr,

D: Uh six
A: Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to
D: the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen .
B: Okay .
D: Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that .
B: Okay .
A: Okay .
D: So um
A: So below forty is okay .
-> A: But we need an lower level which to s uh focus .
--> D: How do you mean ?
-> A: So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ?
-> D: Uh sixteen to forty .
int-rec,

D: Yeah con contrast is
A: Yeah I make it c colour .
D: Yeah okay , colour and brightness .
A: Yeah .
D: Um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ?
D: So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . And then you can um
A: Yeah and automatically um
A: Mm-hmm .
A: 
-> D: Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it .
--> A: Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ?
-> D: Yeah , autoseek .
-> A: Uh name a channel , or
low,

A: Okay .
D: Mm .
B: And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice ,
B: but I don't know if it's worth the cost .
B: So we've got to discuss that .
A: Mm .
A: Okay , jolly good .
B: For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one .
B: You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one ,
-> B: if you know what I mean , so
--> A: What's a double curved one ?
-> B: You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .
B: So
-> A: Okay .
low,

D: Um the most important aspect is look and feel .
D: So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have .
D: So it has to be
A: Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ?
D: Yep .
D: Exactly .
C: Mm .
C: Yeah .
-> D: Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative .
D: So
--> A: What's that mean ?
-> D: Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work .
C: Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense ,
D: Should
C: I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market .
D: That's new .
A: Okay ,
D: Yeah .
-> A: now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .
low,

A: So it's a three .
D: 'Kay .
D: Um , well
D: It's a one . The first item .
D: So , okay the second item .
D: Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .
B: Mm
D: Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market
-> D: and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers .
D: It doesn't look like that .
--> A: So it's a
-> D: That's uh a six .
C: Five .
B: Mm , four .
-> A: Yes , it's for the younger g group .
B: Yeah , but it's it's
A: So it's uh half half of the people .
A: So I think it's four .
int-rec,

C: Um , I drew a badger .
D: Cool .
B: Yay .
A: Badger . Good choice .
C: Well , yeah .
A: Why a badger ?
C: Uh
C: I dunno ,
-> C: they're grumpy and nocturnal and
D: 
--> B: Are you trying to suggest something ?
A: 
-> C: Well , a little bit like the Yes .
C: Um . And then , if you know Wind in the Willows badger .
D: Oh , okay .
C: Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian .
C: He's Liverpudlian writer .
A: Alright .
C: Um , that kind of books .
C: Badgers are cool in that one too .
A: Okay .
A: And I'm last .
int-rec,

B: Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard .
B: And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .
B: So we have some material options .
B: Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium .
B: Um , I'd recommend against titanium
B: because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy .
B: Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .
A: And why not wood ?
B: And ,
-> B: hmm ?
--> A: And why not wood ?
-> B: Uh , well we can use wood .
B: I don't know why we'd want to .
B: Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip .
B: We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular .
B: I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive .
B: So that's what I've got on design .
-> A: 'S good .
not,this instance is an answer to the CR hmm?, the earlier instance could be transfer

C: really
A: if we can do this , that'd probably be
C: Yeah .
C: Uh you wouldn't
C: I don't
C: I just don't think you would even need it .
A: Yeah , yeah .
C: So
-> A: So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's
C: Mean
--> B: Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ?
-> A: yeah .
C: I mean you can do it ,
-> B: I don't know .
low,

B: Um , Project Manager , I have something to tell you .
A: Mm yeah .
B: I have a little problems with my laptop .
A: Okay .
B: And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete .
A: Okay .
B: No , a little problem , uh big problem .
B: I just thought
D: What was it , problem ?
-> B: Um , it didn't work anymore .
--> D: The laptop ?
-> B: The entire Windows uh
-> D: It hang hung .
low,

B: Yeah .
C: So uh
C: so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f
C: I've figured it out that well , uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_ , and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light .
D: 
C: So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_ .
B: Yeah .
C: But , well you just take up all the space ,
-> C: and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used .
B: Okay .
--> A: But you prefer kinetic ?
C: So
-> C: I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery .
A: Okay .
C: I mean , if
-> A: Yeah , but you don't move a a remote control too much .
int-rec,

D: So , that this doesn't apply .
D: 'Kay , the third .
D: Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls .
D: They have to look fancy .
D: Um , they should be technological in innovative .
D: That means uh there have to be fancy things in .
D: Uh , and easy to use .
D: But that's common .
D: My personal preferences .
-> D: We have to aim at a mu at the main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours .
--> A: Would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or
-> D: Uh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point .
A: Okay .
C: 
D: Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control .
A: 
A: Okay .
A: 
C: 
D: Like the Nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one .
A: Yeah .
not,

A: So
D: 
B: Okay .
A: I think we have uh we have decided uh , okay .
D: Consensus .
A: Uh , little more .
D: Oh . Oh . I I have one thing left .
B: Oh .
A: Yeah .
-> D: Maybe for uh Jerome .
--> B: Yeah ? I'm listening .
-> D: Um , the views .
D: Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
A: Like a like a moat or s or something .
D: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
-> B: Um , well
not,

D: One of the number one complaints .
B: Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .
C: Yeah .
D: Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it .
A: 
C: It's bright yellow .
B: 
C: Bright yellow's hard to lose .
-> C: But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing .
C: That was what we'd we'd mentioned .
--> A: So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could
-> C: Just just to use , to find it when it was lost .
C: But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily .
B: Oops .
C: And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things .
B: Hmm .
C: That's gonna be a difficult shape to
B: Well what
-> A: And it is quite bright
A: and
ambig,

A: Hmm .
B: but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on
B: and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_
B: but we will discuss it later maybe .
B: Uh . Components to use ,
B: I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit .
B: It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition ,
C: 
B: because the speech rec
-> B: Yeah ?
--> D: Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ?
-> B: No no no no no .
B: This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays
B: and it's not worth to construct ourselves .
D: Okay s
-> D: So we just buy a circuit board and
not,

A: Okay .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: Not just two discrete buttons for volume ,
D: Okay , n
B: but something which
A: Mm-hmm .
D: Is that because the of the discrete volume levels ,
A: Yeah .
D: or is that
-> B: Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume .
--> A: Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly
D: Yeah .
B: Ah , n .
A: and it can
-> B: If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream .
-> A: Yeah ,
A: also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and
not,

B: 
C: Yeah .
C: Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own
C: 
D: Yeah it's in the um it's in the project documents .
C: Is it meeting three minutes ?
C: No it's not minutes .
D: It's called evaluation criteria .
C: Okay .
-> D: And it's under evaluation .
--> A: Huh , the PowerPoint one ?
B: Hmm ?
-> D: Yeah .
C: Okay . Cool .
D: You've found it all ?
-> A: Yeah .
low,

A: Meeting adjourned .
D: Yeah .
B: I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings .
A: Yeah .
C: 
C: I think it would be a good idea , I like it .
B: It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention .
B: Especially if you have food .
-> A: So I guess we're supposed to write final reports .
A: 'Cause
--> B: All of us ?
-> A: I don't know . Hmm .
low,

C: flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um
C: we also want to limit the number of buttons
D: Mm-hmm .
C: so we'll pretty much take that one as read .
C: We'll use the the basic functions for a television .
D: Mm-hmm .
C: No teletext .
C: Um
C: okay hold on .
-> D: Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap .
--> C: Not enough buttons you mean ?
-> D: Yeah .
D: Well
-> C: So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a
D: Mm .
C: or it looks like we're just cutting on the um
int-tr,I interpret this as a guess answer to a why question

A: And it's got the thing on the inside .
A: And there's no buttons at all ,
A: it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works .
B: 
D: That's a good idea .
C: That sounds ,
A: And then ch children will love it .
-> C: yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry .
D: Interesting .
A: Oh yellow , yellow ball . Right .
--> D: Yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ?
-> C: Please God no .
C: Um . Well , I wouldn't th I mean ,
D: No .
C: my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so
D: Yeah .
C: I think just having it
B: Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it .
-> D: Having a little bit .
not,

A: Okay .
C: So , you can squeeze in it and
A: And uh , the buttons ?
C: Sorry ?
A: Buttons .
C: Buttons on top of it .
C: And here .
-> C: The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .
A: No , it won't .
C: 
--> B: But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ?
-> C: But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here .
C: One till uh uh zero till nine .
A: But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels .
-> B: Yeah , okay .
B: But but how
D: Yeah .
C: And the b
C: 
B: Yeah .
ambig,

A: No . No , no .
D: 
C: 
C: That's how we use it .
D: Uh
C: That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .
A: Yeah , but then you look forward .
D: Uh , yeah , but
-> A: And then you can y
D: Yeah .
--> C: Yeah ?
-> A: N well , if you have to look at it .
D: If you
-> C: 'Kay . Here's our designer .
ambig,

C: yeah .
A: So are
C: So we need to
C: yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on
A: Okay .
C: and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself .
C: So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you .
C: Does anyone have a preference for going first ?
A: Alright .
-> A: I can go first ,
--> C: You wanna go first ?
D: Okay . Hmm .
-> A: yeah .
-> C: Okay ,
C: so we need to unplug my laptop
C: and plug in yours .
A: 
C: I assume we just pull it out ?
int-rec,

C: and a chip ,
D: Mm-hmm .
C: chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations ,
A: Mm-hmm .
C: and wires connecting all chips , which is uh lights , everything ,
A: Yeah .
C: so there should be wires .
B: Okay .
C: And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things
-> C: and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape .
--> B: To keep the remote ?
-> C: Yeah .
-> B: Yeah .
low,

C: Yeah .
B: 
A: yeah , for example you know .
C: Mm .
A: But the question is really , who is our target group .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: Do we look at one target group ?
A: And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have
A: uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group
-> A: how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to
--> D: Respect .
-> A: respect ?
B: 
D: Mm .
B: Okay .
B: No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty
A: Right .
B: and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .
A: With with
A: Mm-hmm .
C: We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know .
int-rec,continuation

A: You
B: but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .
C: Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries
A: Okay .
C: so that that is .
B: Mm .
A: What will be the autonomy ? Roughly ?
B: The what sorry ?
A: The autonomy .
-> A: Autonomy .
--> B: What do you mean ?
-> A: Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?
D: How long the
D: how long the bit the batteries long .
-> B: Ah .
B: Ah .
B: A long time .
A: Yeah .
B: No no no ,
low,

D: Six .
A: six point five .
-> A: Functional .
A: 
B: 
C: I'll give five .
A: Four .
D: I would say
C: 
A: 
--> B: Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ?
D: Everything ar
-> A: Uh for a remote control , does he have all the
-> B: You know .
D: Mm everything
B: Yeah .
B: Yeah .
low,

A: So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about .
A: Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: Well we decided against the solar cells so
A: Oh yeah finally we say no .
C: Solar cells , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , we said no to that .
A: Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines .
-> A: So hand dynamo .
A: This something we didn't thought about .
A: But
--> B: You mean , charging it by shaking the banana .
-> A: Yeah .
C: I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing .
A: Yeah .
C: Yeah .
C: To bring the cost
A: Okay so we we stick to battery , one .
C: Yeah .
A: No kinetic also .
A: I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo .
-> B: Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually
low,

B: So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market .
A: Yep .
A: Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ?
A: Dunno , oranges ?
C: Yeah .
C: The cost of the thing can be made more than might be .
C: Because I think it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to .
B: 
B: Yeah .
-> B: I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the
--> C: Interface .
-> B: Well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside ,
D: Mm-hmm .
B: I'm not sure really how complicated our um
C: Mm-hmm .
B: our needs are .
B: I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers ,
B: do we really need an integrated circuit to
A: Hmm .
B: you know to process that .
C: Mm-hmm .
int-rec,continuation

A: Okay , now .
A: So we I guess we use one .
C: Yeah .
B: Yes .
A: What ?
A: T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected .
A: Well , that's nice .
A: She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would
-> A: It doesn't work .
A: Hmm .
--> D: Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or
-> A: Oh , okay yeah , okay ,
C: Yeah .
A: let's see .
A: Okay , one , okay .
B: Yes .
A: Oh go away .
A: Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: Uh electronics , simple chip on print ?
A: Is that's what we're using ?
not,

C: Yeah .
C: 
A: I'm sorry to interrupt then
A: but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features , okay ?
C: Included , yeah .
C: Hmm ,
C: hmm
B: Yeah mm .
A: So to beware of that .
-> A: You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?
--> D: Uh , well I isn't this my last slide ?
D: Maybe .
-> A: I dunno .
-> D: Go ahead .
int-tr,

A: 'Kay .
A: Okay .
A: Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ?
C: Yeah ,
C: it's in the should be in the m Project .
A: Okay .
D: Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or
-> C: You know you could you could do it yourself actually .
A: Oh .
B: Did you send it ?
--> A: Save it in the project documents .
C: Put it in Project Documents ,
-> C: yeah .
-> A: Okay .
A: Mm-mm-mm .
A: This one ?
low,clarification of "do it"

D: Wait ,
D: is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ?
A: Kind of .
C: Except the entire screen .
B: It's the entire screen is just running information at random .
A: Yeah it's the whole screen .
-> C: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment ,
A: So anyway
B: Seemingly .
C: you know it's like
--> D: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ?
A: Right .
A: Right .
-> C: Yeah .
A: But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet .
A: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news ,
A: and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so
A: Those are our new product requirements .
D: Okay .
B: Okay .
B: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ?
A: Alright . Mm-hmm .
A: Yes .
ambig,could not be a CR, or be low, very unclear

A: Mm .
A: get your own remote , or digital cable .
B: Yeah .
A: 'Kay . Um .
A: I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later ,
A: making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um .
B: Yeah ,
B: 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so
A: 'Kay .
-> A: And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .
--> C: The colour being yellow ?
D: Wait .
-> A: I'm guessing .
C: And how do we
D: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish .
A: And the R_R_ .
B: R_ the double R_ .
A: We could just have the logo in yellow ,
-> C: Can't make it entirely
low,

A: And I like its overall uh aggressive look and
A: Well , that's what I like about uh piranha .
B: Okay .
A: I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be .
A: Well , who wants to be next ?
D: Nobody , I guess .
B: I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh
A: You go , Guido ? Okay .
A: Uh , make a new sheet .
-> A: Uh , it's by pressing on blank .
--> B: Blank ?
-> A: Yep .
-> B: Okay .
D: 
B: Then pen again ?
ambig,either low "did you just say blank?" or doing a check on intention

A: No , we're uh ahead of schedule then .
D: Team Leader .
D: He is the whatever .
A: Yeah , close it .
A: I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes .
B: Okay .
D: Yes .
-> A: And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations .
B: Okay .
A: You can all Or we're all uh
--> D: Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board .
-> A: Yeah .
A: Yeah , but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ?
-> D: Yeah .
D: Yes .
ambig,not CR?

B: so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .
D: No .
D: Yeah ,
D: yeah .
B: But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .
D: Mm-hmm .
B: Um right , okay .
B: Let me just scoot on ahead here .
B: Okay .
-> B: Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ?
--> D: Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other
B: Thin
-> B: No , actually .
B: That would be useful , though ,
D: other
B: wouldn't it ,
B: if you knew like what your money would get you now .
-> D: Yeah .
A: Hmm .
D: Mm-hmm .
B: Mm-hmm .
D: Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l
not,

D: Black white , maybe ?
B: Like white , also ni or uh always nice .
C: And what colours should the buttons be ?
D: Uh
D: Because um
A: Yeah , different colours .
A: This is
B: Just um
A: Oh , the same as th th the cover .
-> A: But also th the light behind it .
--> C: But can you change those too , with uh the switch ?
B: Yes .
-> A: No , no .
A: Make them
A: No , just make them black or grey or something .
B: Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think .
-> C: Okay .
int-tr,

C: Mm two , I think .
B: N
A: Targeted audience .
A: Uh we are the targeted audience ?
A: Do we like it ?
D: No ,
D: we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty .
A: Yeah , but l younger than forty .
D: Yes .
-> A: So we we are exactly the targeted group .
--> D: Yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ?
D: Th that's my question .
-> A: I think so , yeah .
A: You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people .
C: Yeah .
C: We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So
A: So you want
D: Yeah .
-> D: Yeah .
D: Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question .
not,

D: Yes .
D: No it's your choice .
B: Wow , that's pretty quick .
D: Tu-dum .
B: Uh uh um
D: Just pick one .
B: You have to decide .
B: It's the lower one .
D: What's this ? A bomb or not a bo
-> B: No no , the upper one is the bomb .
--> D: This the bomb ?
-> B: Yes .
B: 
-> D: Wrong .
D: Shit .
low,

B: Uh , no sorry ,
A: 
B: it should be
C: Six . Five or six .
D: What are we doing ?
B: No
A: What are we doing ?
B: sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry ,
D: Adding them up ?
-> B: we are doing a very wrong thing .
--> A: We're gonna average them ?
-> B: Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything ,
-> A: Okay . So seven fourths .
int-rec,

D: I played I think seven times Solitaire something .
B: 
C: 
B: Oh
A: You did ?
A: Well ,
A: I didn't have time for that .
B: did you ?
B: Is it on there ?
-> D: Wha
--> B: Is it on there ?
B: I didn't find the didn't look but uh
A: At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment ,
-> D: Oh right ,
C: Was searching and searching .
D: it is there .
-> B: I didn't look ,
B: but
not,answer to a CR

B: Hmm .
D: Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative .
D: Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria .
D: Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well ,
D: but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control .
D: From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture .
D: So , I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category .
-> D: And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .
A: Okay .
D: Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way .
--> B: What does it mean , spongy ?
-> D: Uh sort of um squishy .
D: Um . Yeah soft ,
-> B: Like soft , or something ?
low,

A: Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know .
B: So um
A: Where is the clay ?
C: 
B: do
B: I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting ,
B: would you say ?
C: Yeah .
-> D: they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber .
A: Mm-hmm .
--> C: The fruit and veg .
C: This one .
B: Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling .
-> D: Yeah .
A: Mm . I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing .
C: 
A: Bu but um but the spongy idea I like . I like it a lot .
B: 
B: We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite
C: Yeah .
A: 
C: Yeah .
A: I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea ,
int-rec,sort of continuation

A: Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates .
B: Yeah .
D: Mm-hmm .
A: Um , is it
A: I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there .
A: Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate .
A: It would work that way .
-> B: Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case .
C: W
B: So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .
--> C: Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top
-> B: Yeah .
B: Like
A: Yeah .
B: I can't think of what .
-> C: Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing ,
int-rec,

A: Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .
C: Mm .
D: I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to .
D: Just because of colour clashing ,
D: and if we wanted to ,
A: Yeah .
A: Yeah .
D: so and ,
-> D: and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .
C: But um
--> A: But what about the lighting up effect ?
-> D: You mean different colours for the lighting or
-> A: Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up .
A: And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up .
int-tr,

D: 
A: 
C: well we haven't really made any decisions about
C: what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use .
C: Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ?
A: Um
C: You know how um different interfaces are very different ,
C: and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have .
A: Mm-hmm .
-> C: We haven't really decided what to do about that .
--> A: Um , what are our choices here ?
-> C: Well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons .
C: What kind of functions wi shall we have ?
-> A: You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ?
not,

C: So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop .
B: Mm .
B: Yeah .
C: It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly .
B: 
C: Otherwise it's just lying idle .
A: Okay Michael .
B: Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe
B: be easier to
-> A: Sorry ?
--> B: could I use the mouse , or
-> A: Um yeah .
-> B: Mm . Thanks .
B: Okay .
not,answer to a CR

A: it's on the um eraser now ,
A: so we click the pen button .
A: Okay , so not too fast writing .
A: Um
A: you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button .
A: It's quite the same .
A: Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file .
-> A: So do not m make a new file .
A: Just use this one uh during the day .
A: Um you can use the eraser to make something go away .
--> B: But we all use the same white-board file
-> A: Yes .
-> B: So we can work together on it while we're
B: or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?
int-tr,

A: Yeah .
A: Uh Ruud , y do you agree ?
D: Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .
A: Okay . Okay .
B: Um
B: Well , the techni fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ .
B: That's just the basic f technical function .
A: Yeah .
-> B: So that was my really my part for uh this session .
B: Um
--> A: So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um
C: Yeah .
C: 
-> B: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do ,
B: wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device .
C: Mm-hmm .
B: It just should change the T_V_'s state .
A: Okay .
B: So that's it .
B: Um but furthermore
C: And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ?
B: Yeah . Yeah , with buttons .
C: Or are there any o other controls ?
ambig,could it be interpreted as transfer? 

C: because she had
D: Oh , wait .
D: That's
D: is that it ?
B: Adjusting .
A: Here we are .
A: 
B: The cable might be a little loose or something .
-> D: Right here we are .
B: Oh , you got it .
--> A: Oh . Is it on ?
-> D: We're here .
-> A: Okay .
not,

B: and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work ,
B: um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone .
C: Okay .
C: Okay .
D: Yeah .
D: Okay .
C: Alright .
A: Okay .
-> B: Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .
C: Okay .
--> A: So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can
-> B: It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote .
A: right .
A: Yeah , yeah .
D: So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?
B: Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_
B: so if you need to find the remote , click the button .
D: Okay .
D: Okay .
C: So it's now like a two-part thing .
B: Yeah , so it would be a two part package .
not,

A: Yeah .
C: But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive ,
C: like , it has to be
C: is that part of
A: Is that what makes them expensi
C: yeah ,
-> B: I don't think so .
A: I think it's all of
C: I dunno , I dunno .
A: they have so much memory though ,
--> C: You don't think so ?
A: that's it's
-> B: I don't think it's the wheel dealy .
-> C: Okay .
int-tr,

D: Um .
A: 
C: 
D: I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit ,
-> D: but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable ,
D: some kind of
D: instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something .
C: Mm-hmm .
D: But yeah it it depends on the
A: So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ .
--> B: Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit ,
A: 
A: 
B: or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the
C: Means buttons are in the shape of fruits ,
-> D: Yeah maybe the shape the shape
C: buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that .
D: No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different .
A: Apple for channel one .
C: 
C: Mm-hmm .
C: Mm-hmm .
D: So we shouldn't be at re really attached
D: to to the trend
-> B: So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant .
int-rec,

B: so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build .
A: 
C: I don't th
C: it will be rolling a lot .
D: Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so
A: Okay .
A: Yeah
A: and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also .
B: Yeah .
-> D: Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ?
--> A: Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not .
B: Well , this is
D: I think
-> D: Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation ,
A: 
D: so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the
A: So
A: So you you you suggest to go f
D: new inputs
D: and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_
D: because you need uh internet connection , you need more things ,
D: it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying uh
A: Okay .
int-tr,

A: I
A: there's something that I unclear really understanding .
A: Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ?
B: It's it it's no , well ,
B: it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase .
B: You train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase ,
B: you say
B: the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um
B: well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is ,
-> B: you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ?
--> A: And it's just to , it's just to playback something ?
-> B: Yeah .
B: So actually that was a bad example ,
B: 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so .
-> A: Yeah yeah .
A: So this is not s really to do to to do control .
not,

B: But um ,
B: I've also included this turbo button
B: because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button ,
D: What's a turbo button ?
B: and well
B: so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll ,
B: so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh
B: Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them ,
B: in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station .
-> B: Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing .
--> D: It con it controls the speed ?
-> B: Yeah ,
B: so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them
B: and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever .
A: 
B: So yeah , that's um ,
B: those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote ,
C: Mm-hmm .
B: but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um .
B: You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device ,
B: I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality ,
not,

A: Okay right .
A: Good .
B: And , uh
A: So no L_C_D_ .
B: No L_C_D_ .
A: Okay great . Um .
A: Very good .
C: Okay .
-> B: Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well .
A: Yeah .
--> C: Uh for the remote ?
-> B: Yeah .
A: Oh , just the switch ,
-> C: Remotes don't have power on off switch .
int-tr,

C: That's that's another issue which I didn't think of .
B: Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um
C: But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make .
D: What about
B: Yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ?
B: I can't remember ,
-> C: Twenty five .
D: 
C: Twelve point five is the profit on one .
A: Twenty five .
--> B: Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ?
-> C: Uh forty th four .
D: Four millions ?
C: Point point four million ?
-> B: Four point four million .
not,

C: Mm .
C: Extra .
C: Yeah , okay .
C: Mm .
C: Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so ,
B: First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light
C: yeah .
-> B: and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device
C: Mm .
C: Mm-hmm .
--> A: But it can be uh battery consuming , no ?
A: To have the light always on ?
-> B: Yeah , a little bit .
B: A little bit .
C: Mm .
-> A: Well we will discuss that after maybe
int-tr,

B: 
B: Yeah .
A: be better , I think .
A: And uh
A: And so uh
C: 
A: you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual .
C: Mm-hmm .
A: So
-> C: Yes master .
--> A: do you need to add anything ?
-> C: No .
-> A: You feel okay ?
int-rec,not clear whether this question is actually related to C's "yes master"

C: I reckon one problem with speech recognition is
C: um I've actually seen one of them used
C: and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing ,
-> C: so you end up yelling at the control for hours .
A: 
B: Really ?
D: Right .
C: Channel up .
D: Oh really , you've seen one before .
C: 
--> B: Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ?
C: Um
-> C: I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .
A: Sorry ,
A: do you mind passing me my notepad .
-> B: Mm . Course not .
int-rec,

A: And here's the agenda for this meeting .
A: Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards .
A: You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product
A: that I can see some demonstrations of over there .
A: Looks cool .
A: And then we're gonna evaluate it .
D: Bra
B: 
A: Then we're gonna talk about finance ,
-> A: and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this .
--> C: Hmm you knocked it up ?
A: And uh
-> A: yep .
B: 
C: 
A: And we're gonna evaluate the product and close .
A: Got forty minutes to do this in .
A: We should be fine .
A: Let's try and keep this one on schedule .
B: Alright .
A: So
C:
int-rec,

A: that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around ,
C: Use them like that .
B: Pedro's right .
A: but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down .
B: Pedro's right .
A: I don't care .
A: Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid .
C: 
-> A: What new ideas have we found ?
B: Oh wel
--> D: New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or
D: what are we ta
-> A: Well let's do both then .
A: Uh for the product ?
B: Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature .
-> D: Oh .
low,

D: yeah , worked well .
A: Yeah .
C: And we were a able to modify each other's ideas
D: Mm-hmm .
B: Yeah .
C: to fit in with our areas of expertise .
A: Yeah .
A: Each other's
D: Oh does it have smart materials by the way ?
-> B: Sorry ?
--> D: Does it have smart materials ?
A: Mm .
-> B: Oh yeah .
-> D: Oh yeah .
not,answer to a CR
